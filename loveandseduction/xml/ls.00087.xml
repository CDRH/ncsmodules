         <head>1. </head><p>"Desire, particularly as opposed to romantic love,
has been the subject of intense, widespread critical scrutiny in the last
twenty years in the works of postmodern Continental theorists and those writing
in an Anglo-American context. Roland Barthes's strict distinction between
desire as opposed to romantic love has been extremely influential. Thus Robert
Polhemus, implicitly expanding on Barthes's distinction, has used the term
'erotic faith' to describe romantic love, noting that throughout European
culture narratives of love have served to imagine 'forms of faith that would
augment or substitute for orthodox religious visions.' Critics addressing the
strictly formal dimensions of literary texts, as well as theorists seeking a
more politically pronounced emphasis on how fiction operates in a matrix of
cultural determinants, have turned to desire as a crucial locus of meaning.
Rene Girard's exploration of 'triangular desire'; Barthes's intensely personal
endorsement of 'bliss' and 'pleasure'; the hymeneal 'dissemination' evoked by
Jacques Derrida; Julia Kristeva's semiotic, signifying stress on process; Leo
Bersani's focus on the fluid fragmented staging of desublimated carnality;
Judith Butler's elaboration of sexuality as sheer 'performance'; Tim Dean's
Lacanian exploration of desire as fundamentally impersonal&#8212;have all accentuated
an eroticism that is mutable and unstable, in which functional desire emerges
as a historical aberration. For many postmodern critics, that aberration is a
scandalously successful nineteenth-century literary invention that has come to
legitimize patriarchally and heterosexually structured social scenarios" (2-3)</p>
</div>
<div>
         <head>2. </head><p>"....In a male-dominated order, in which marriage was
prized as a satisfying resolution, flirting represents a reckless adventurism
that violates&#8212;and sometimes succeeds in undermining&#8212;the smooth functioning of
middle-class interests and aspirations. Within the context of
nineteenth-century fiction, that violation often emerges as a subtly intimated,
dissident gesture at the center of a larger, apparently well-settled narrative of
connubial bliss" (4).</p></div>
