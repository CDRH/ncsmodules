            <p>"The garden is a central and sacred space in Christian mythology. Of the three
               crucial events of human history, two&#8212;the birth of the race into innocence
               and the fall of the race into sin&#8212;are located in the garden; only the final
               redemption, which returns humankind to the very bosom of God, is reserved for a realm
               beyond Nature" (761).</p>

            <head>2.</head>
            <p>". . . Walter E. Houghton observes in <hi rend="italic">The Victorian Frame of
                  Mind,</hi> 'When the religious emotions of worship were denied a divine object,
               they could readily turn to a human one, to a hero or a heroine; and romantic love,
               called on to fill the vacuum, could take on a new fervor and importance.' But, while
               the fervor may have been new, spawned by a desperation that now drove the search for
               salvation, romantic love had long been endowed with a particular importance when
               placed within the confines of the garden. As Terry Comito asserts in <hi
                  rend="italic">The Idea of the Garden in the Renaissance</hi>: 'what is shared by
               monks, poets, philosophers, lovers&#8212;even...constructors of artificial
               perspective&#8212;is a nostalgia for Paradise. Gardens set aside for poetry or
               contemplation or love all participate in a glamour appropriate to sacred places; and
               conversely, activities so apparently distinct as poetry or contemplation or love take
               on, through their association with gardens, the aspect of a single quest, a turning
               outward to the world, a search for an equilibrium in which mind and thing constitute
               one another in a creative blossoming like that of the first Garden.' Yet, like
               religion, such ceremonies of innocence were bound to be drowned in the scientific
               deluge of the mid-nineteenth century. Romantic love, in a garden setting, is featured
               prominently in three works of the period: Alfred, Lord Tennyson's <hi rend="italic"
                  >Maud,</hi> completed in 1855, Charles Dickens's <hi rend="italic">Great
                  Expectations,</hi> serialized in 1860 to 1861; and W.S. Gilbert's play <hi
                  rend="italic">Sweethearts,</hi> produced in 1874. And, by the end of the brief
               nineteen years that separate the first from the last of these, neither love nor the
               garden is assigned the same spiritual significance as it was before" (765-66).</p>

            <head>3.</head>
            <p> [In <hi rend="italic">Maud</hi>], "the speaker's attempted entry into the garden is
               the climax of his story. He has previously seen and spoken of Maud in this garden but
               has never tried to cross its boundaries. However, on the night of the ball hosted by
               her brother, he intends to change this:</p>
            <lg type="poem">

               <l>For I am not invited,</l>

               <l>But, with the Sultan's pardon,</l>

               <l>I am all as well delighted,</l>

               <l>For I know her own rose-garden,</l>

               <l>And mean to linger in it</l>

               <l>Till the dancing will be over;</l>

               <l>And then, Oh, then, come out to me</l>

               <l>For a minute, but for a minute,</l>

               <l>Come out to your own true lover,</l>

               <l>That your true lover may see</l>

               <l>Your glory also, and render</l>

               <l>All homage to his own darling,</l>

               <l>Queen Maud in all her splendour.</l>
            </lg>

            <p>He has actually entered the forbidden precincts by the time that he rhapsodizes his
               way through the serenade that is the poem's best-known section&#8212;'Come into
               the garden, Maud.' In the context of his own myth, the speaker's audacious actions
               are equivalent to nothing less than an attempt by postlapsarian man to storm the
               guarded gates of the earthly paradise and there embrace his own
               salvation&#8212;personified for this speaker by Maud&#8212;in the here and
               now of this world. But this trespass into 'Eden' ironically evokes that great enemy
               of salvation, Milton's Satan. It is thus not surprising that the result of the
               speaker's action proves not to be redemption but another fall, for it is now that he
               does the Cain-like deed of killing Maud's brother" (769-70).</p>
