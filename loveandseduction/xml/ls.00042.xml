    <head type="editorial">Scene Two: Jo and Laurie flirt inconsequentially on a sofa</head>

<p>When Laurie first went to college, he fell in love about
once a month, but these small flames were as brief as ardent,
did no damage, and much amused Jo, who took great interest in
the alternations of hope, despair, and resignation, which were
confided to her in their weekly conferences. But there came a
time when Laurie ceased to worship at many shrines, hinted
darkly at one all-absorbing passion, and indulged occasionally
in Byronic fits of gloom. Then he avoided the tender subject
altogether, wrote philosophical notes to Jo, turned studious,
and gave out that he was going to 'dig', intending to graduate
in a blaze of glory. This suited the young lady better than
twilight confidences, tender pressures of the hand, and
eloquent glances of the eye, for with Jo, brain developed
earlier than heart, and she preferred imaginary heroes to
real ones, because when tired of them, the former could be
shut up in the tin kitchen till called for, and the latter
were less manageable.</p>

<p>Things were in this state when the grand discovery was
made, and Jo watched Laurie that night as she had never done
before. If she had not got the new idea into her head, she
would have seen nothing unusual in the fact that Beth was
very quiet, and Laurie very kind to her. But having given the
rein to her lively fancy, it galloped away with her at a great
pace, and common sense, being rather weakened by a long course
of romance writing, did not come to the rescue. As usual Beth
lay on the sofa and Laurie sat in a low chair close by, amusing
her with all sorts of gossip, for she depended on her weekly
'spin', and he never disappointed her. But that evening Jo
fancied that Beth's eyes rested on the lively, dark face
beside her with peculiar pleasure, and that she listened with
intense interest to an account of some exciting cricket match,
though the phrases, 'caught off a tice', 'stumped off his ground',
and 'the leg hit for three', were as intelligible to her as
Sanskrit. She also fancied, having set her heart upon seeing it,
that she saw a certain increase of gentleness in Laurie's manner,
that he dropped his voice now and then, laughed less than usual,
was a little absent-minded, and settled the afghan over Beth's
feet with an assiduity that was really almost tender.</p>

<p>"Who knows? Stranger things have happened," thought Jo,
as she fussed about the room. "She will make quite an angel
of him, and he will make life delightfully easy and pleasant
for the dear, if they only love each other. I don't see how he
can help it, and I do believe he would if the rest of us were out of
the way."</p>

<p>As everyone <hi rend="italic">was</hi> out of the way but herself, Jo began to
feel that she ought to dispose of herself with all speed. But
where should she go?  And burning to lay herself upon the shrine
of sisterly devotion, she sat down to settle that point.</p>

<p>Now, the old sofa was a regular patriarch of a sofa&#8212;long,
broad, well-cushioned, and low, a trifle shabby, as well it might
be, for the girls had slept and sprawled on it as babies,
fished over the back, rode on the arms, and had menageries
under it as children, and rested tired heads, dreamed dreams,
and listened to tender talk on it as young women. They all loved
it, for it was a family refuge, and one corner had always been
Jo's favorite lounging place. Among the many pillows that adorned
the venerable couch was one, hard, round, covered with prickly
horsehair, and furnished with a knobby button at each end. This
repulsive pillow was her especial property, being used as a weapon
of defense, a barricade, or a stern preventive of too much slumber.</p>

<p>Laurie knew this pillow well, and had cause to regard it with
deep aversion, having been unmercifully pummeled with it in former
days when romping was allowed, and now frequently debarred by it
from the seat he most coveted next to Jo in the sofa corner. If
'the sausage' as they called it, stood on end, it was a sign that
he might approach and repose, but if it lay flat across the sofa,
woe to man, woman, or child who dared disturb it! That evening
Jo forgot to barricade her corner, and had not been in her seat
five minutes, before a massive form appeared beside her, and with
both arms spread over the sofa back, both long legs stretched out
before him, Laurie exclaimed, with a sigh of satisfaction:</p>

<p>"Now, <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is filling at the price."</p>

<p>"No slang," snapped Jo, slamming down the pillow. But it was
too late, there was no room for it, and coasting onto the floor,
it disappeared in a most mysterious manner.</p> 

<p>"Come, Jo, don't be thorny. After studying himself to a
skeleton all the week, a fellow deserves petting and ought to get
it."</p>

<p>"Beth will pet you. I'm busy."</p>

<p>"No, she's not to be bothered with me, but you like that sort
of thing, unless you've suddenly lost your taste for it. Have you?
Do you hate your boy, and want to fire pillows at him?"</p>

<p>Anything more wheedlesome than that touching appeal was seldom
heard, but Jo quenched 'her boy' by turning on him with a stern
query, "How many bouquets have you sent Miss Randal this week?"</p>

<p>"Not one, upon my word. She's engaged. Now then."</p>

<p>"I'm glad of it, that's one of your foolish extravagances,
sending flowers and things to girls for whom you don't care two
pins," continued Jo reprovingly.</p>

<p>"Sensible girls for whom I do care whole papers of pins won't let me
send them 'flowers and things', so what can I do?  My feelings need a
<hi rend="italic">went</hi>."</p>

<p>"Mother doesn't approve of flirting even in fun, and you do
flirt desperately, Teddy."</p>

<p>"I'd give anything if I could answer, 'So do you'. As I can't,
I'll merely say that I don't see any harm in that pleasant little
game, if all parties understand that it's only play."</p>

<p>"Well, it does look pleasant, but I can't learn how it's done.
I've tried, because one feels awkward in company not to do as
everybody else is doing, but I don't seem to get on", said Jo,
forgetting to play mentor.</p>

<p>"Take lessons of Amy, she has a regular talent for it."</p>

<p>"Yes, she does it very prettily, and never seems to go too
far. I suppose it's natural to some people to please without
trying, and others to always say and do the wrong thing in the
wrong place."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you can't flirt. It's really refreshing to see a
sensible, straightforward girl, who can be jolly and kind without
making a fool of herself. Between ourselves, Jo, some of the
girls I know really do go on at such a rate I'm ashamed of them.
They don't mean any harm, I'm sure, but if they knew how we
fellows talked about them afterward, they'd mend their ways, I
fancy."</p>

<p>"They do the same, and as their tongues are the sharpest,
you fellows get the worst of it, for you are as silly as they,
every bit. If you behaved properly, they would, but knowing
you like their nonsense, they keep it up, and then you blame
them."</p>

<p>"Much you know about it, ma'am," said Laurie in a superior tone.
"We don't like romps and flirts, though we may act as if
we did sometimes. The pretty, modest girls are never
talked about, except respectfully, among gentleman.
Bless your innocent soul! If you could be in my place
for a month you'd see things that would astonish you a trifle.
Upon my word, when I see one of those harum-scarum girls,
I always want to say with our friend Cock Robin:</p>
	
	<lg type="poem">
	<l><hi rend="italic">"Out upon you, fie upon you,</hi></l>
 	<l><hi rend="italic">Bold-faced jig!"</hi></l>
		</lg>

<p>It was impossible to help laughing at the funny conflict
between Laurie's chivalrous reluctance to speak ill of womankind,
and his very natural dislike of the unfeminine folly of
which fashionable society showed him many samples. Jo knew
that 'young Laurence' was regarded as a most eligible <hi rend="italic">parti</hi>
by worldly mamas, was much smiled upon by their daughters,
and flattered enough by ladies of all ages to make a coxcomb
of him, so she watched him rather jealously, fearing
he would be spoiled, and rejoiced more than she confessed
to find that he still believed in modest girls. Returning
suddenly to her admonitory tone, she said, dropping her
voice, "If you <hi rend="italic">must</hi> have a 'went', Teddy, go and devote
yourself to one of the 'pretty, modest girls' whom you do
respect, and not waste your time with the silly ones."</p>

<p>"You really advise it?" and Laurie looked at her with
an odd mixture of anxiety and merriment in his face.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do, but you'd better wait till you are through
college, on the whole, and be fitting yourself for the place
meantime. You're not half good enough for&#8212;well, whoever
the modest girl may be." and Jo looked a little queer likewise,
for a name had almost escaped her.</p>

<p>"That I'm not!" acquiesced Laurie, with an expression of
humility quite new to him, as he dropped his eyes and absently
wound Jo's apron tassel round his finger.</p>

<p>"Mercy on us, this will never do," thought Jo, adding
aloud, "Go and sing to me. I'm dying for some music, and
always like yours."</p>

<p>"I'd rather stay here, thank you."</p>

<p>"Well, you can't, there isn't room. Go and make yourself
useful, since you are too big to be ornamental. I thought you
hated to be tied to a woman's apron string?" retorted Jo,
quoting certain rebellious words of his own.</p>

<p>"Ah, that depends on who wears the apron!" and Laurie
gave an audacious tweak at the tassel.</p>

<p>"Are you going?" demanded Jo, diving for the pillow.</p>

<p>He fled at once, and the minute it was well, "Up with the
bonnets of bonnie Dundee," she slipped away to return no more
till the young gentleman departed in high dudgeon.</p>
