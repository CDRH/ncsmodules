<head type="editorial">scene one: Beach scene that leads to regret</head>

         <lg1 type="poem">
         
		<lg2 type="stanza">
         <l>Here about the beach I wander'd,
nourishing a youth sublime </l>

         <l>With the fairy tales of science,
and the long result of Time; </l>

         </lg2>
	<lg2 type="stanza">
         <l>When the centuries behind me like
a fruitful land reposed; </l>

         <l>When I clung to all the present
for the promise that it closed: </l>
	</lg2>
		<lg2 type="stanza">

         <l>When I dipt into the future far as
human eye could see; </l>

         <l>Saw the Vision of the world and
all the wonder that would be.&#8212; </l>
		</lg2>

		<lg2 type="stanza">
         <l>In the Spring a fuller crimson
comes upon the robin's breast; </l>

         <l>In the Spring the wanton lapwing
gets himself another crest; </l>
		</lg2>

		<lg2 type="stanza">
         <l>In the Spring a livelier iris
changes on the burnish'd dove; </l>

         <l>In the Spring a young man's fancy
lightly turns to thoughts of love. </l>
		</lg2>

		<lg2 type="stanza">
         <l>Then her cheek was pale and
thinner than should be for one so young, </l>

         <l>And her eyes on all my motions
with a mute observance hung. </l>
		</lg2>

	<lg2 type="stanza">
         <l>And I said, "My cousin Amy,
speak, and speak the truth to me, </l>

         <l>Trust me, cousin, all the current
of my being sets to thee." </l>
		</lg2>

	<lg2 type="stanza">
         <l>On her pallid cheek and forehead
came a colour and a light, </l>

         <l>As I have seen the rosy red
flushing in the northern night. </l>
		</lg2>

	<lg2 type="stanza">
         <l>And she turn'd her bosom shaken
with a sudden storm of sighs &#8212; </l>

         <l>All the spirit deeply dawning in
the dark of hazel eyes &#8212; </l>
		</lg2>

	<lg2 type="stanza">
         <l>Saying, "I have hid my
feelings, fearing they should do me wrong"; </l>

         <l>Saying, "Dost thou love me,
cousin?" weeping, "I have loved thee long." </l>
		</lg2>

	<lg2 type="stanza">
         <l>Love took up the glass of Time,
and turn'd it in his glowing hands; </l>

         <l>Every moment, lightly shaken, ran
itself in golden sands. </l>
		</lg2>

	<lg2 type="stanza">
         <l>Love took up the harp of Life, and
smote on all the chords with might; </l>

         <l>Smote the chord of Self, that,
trembling, pass'd in music out of sight. </l>
		</lg2>

	<lg2 type="stanza">
         <l>Many a morning on the moorland did
we hear the copses ring, </l>

         <l>And her whisper throng'd my pulses
with the fullness of the Spring. </l>
		</lg2>

	<lg2 type="stanza">
         <l>Many an evening by the waters did
we watch the stately ships, </l>

         <l>And our spirits rush'd together at
the touching of the lips. </l>
		</lg2>

	<lg2 type="stanza">
         <l>O my cousin, shallow-hearted! O my
Amy, mine no more! </l>

         <l>O the dreary, dreary moorland! O
the barren, barren shore! </l>
		</lg2>

	<lg2 type="stanza">
         <l>Falser than all fancy fathoms,
falser than all songs have sung, </l>

         <l>Puppet to a father's threat, and
servile to a shrewish tongue! </l>
		</lg2>

	<lg2 type="stanza">
         <l>Is it well to wish thee
happy? &#8212; having known me &#8212;to decline </l>

         <l>On a range of lower feelings and a
narrower heart than mine! </l>
		</lg2>

	<lg2 type="stanza">
         <l>Yet it shall be; thou shalt lower
to his level day by day, </l>

         <l>What is fine within thee growing
coarse to sympathize with clay. </l>
		</lg2>

	<lg2 type="stanza">
         <l>As the husband is, the wife is:
thou art mated with a clown, </l>

         <l>And the grossness of his nature
will have weight to drag thee down. </l>
		</lg2>

	<lg2 type="stanza">
         <l>He will hold thee, when his
passion shall have spent its novel force, </l>

         <l>Something better than his dog, a
little dearer than his horse. </l>
		</lg2>

	<lg2 type="stanza">
         <l>What is this? his eyes are heavy;
think not they are glazed with wine. </l>

         <l>Go to him, it is thy duty, kiss
him, take his hand in thine. </l>
		</lg2>

	<lg2 type="stanza">
         <l>It may be my lord is weary, that
his brain is overwrought: </l>

         <l>Soothe him with thy finer fancies,
touch him with thy lighter thought. </l>
		</lg2>

	<lg2 type="stanza">
         <l>He will answer to the purpose,
easy things to understand &#8212; </l>

         <l>Better thou wert dead before me,
tho' I slew thee with my hand! </l>
		</lg2>

	<lg2 type="stanza">
         <l>Better thou and I were lying,
hidden from the heart's disgrace, </l>

         <l>Roll'd in one another's arms, and
silent in a last embrace. </l>
		</lg2>

	<lg2 type="stanza">
         <l>Cursed be the social wants that
sin against the strength of youth! </l>

         <l>Cursed be the social lies that
warp us from the living truth! </l>
		</lg2>

		<lg2 type="stanza">
         <l>Cursed be the sickly forms that
err from honest Nature's rule! </l>

	<l>Cursed be the gold that gilds the
straiten'd forehead of the fool! </l>
		</lg2>
	</lg1>
