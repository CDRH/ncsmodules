"From the end of the eighteenth century with the
debate on over-population and the hyperbreeding of the poor, sexuality pervades
the social consciousness: from the widespread discussions of the birthrate,
deathrate, life expectancy and fertility in the statistical forays of the
century to the urgent controversies over public health, housing, birth control
and prostitution. . . .The reports of the great Parliamentary Commissions, which
in the 1830s and 1840s investigated working conditions in factories and mines,
were saturated with an obsessive concern with the sexuality of the working
class, the social other, displacing in the end the acute social crisis from the
area of exploitation and class conflict, where it could not be coped with, into
the framework of a more amenable and discussable area of 'morality'. From the
1850s sexuality, particularly in the wide area of venereal disease and
prostitution (allied to feats that Britain would follow Rome into imperial
decline) enters the heart of Parliamentary debate. The controversy over the
Contagious Diseases Acts, passed in the 1860s to impose compulsory medical
examination and registration on working-class women suspected of being
prostitutes in designated garrison and naval towns, generated an avalanche of
controversy and publications. The Acts were the subject of repeated
Parliamentary enquiries, while the repeal organizations alone published at
least 520 books and pamphlets on venereal disease and prostitution. Between
1870 and 1885, 17,367 petitions against the Acts, with 2,606,429 signatures
were presented to the House of Commons, and over 900 public meetings were held
by supporters of repeal.</p>

         <p>Other legislative changes produced their own
effects. The divorce act of 1857 evinced a flurry of interest in the next
decade in stories of bigamy and adultery: a special paper, <hi rend="italic">The Divorce News
and Police Reporter, </hi>was founded to cater for specialized tastes, but other
Victorian papers, like their more familiar twentieth-century offspring, were
full of divorce cases and other sexual scandals" (19-20).</p></div>

        <div>             <head>2. </head><p>
"The popular morality of the vast majority was no
less strict for being loosely Christian in a formal sense. As G.R. Quaife has
put it, 'God does not loom large as a damper on lower-class sexual activity.' 
This should not be taken to imply that there was in any sense an unrestrained
licence for peasant sexuality; there was no 'amorality' in a fundamental
sense. There was, on the contrary, an often strict morality, enforced through
various informal and traditional methods such as those of public shaming, the
charivari and skimmington rides. But it was a <hi rend="italic">social </hi>morality, in which
the potential economic burden to the community of bastards mattered more than
the 'immorality' of premarital sex.' </p>

         <p>
What seems to be happening in the nineteenth
century, in response to major social changes (rapid industrialization and
urbanization, the disruption of old class patterns and the rise of capitalist
social relations, the development of new and sharp class conflicts with their related
social and intellectual manifestations) is a continuous battle over the
definition of acceptable sexual behaviour within the context of changing class
and power relations. And there are different rhythms in this process. There
was no blanket imposition of 'repression.' Not until the 1880s did 'social
purity' have any major legislative purchase; and it is significant that it is
from this period that the earliest critiques of 'Victorianism' stem" (22-23).</p>

"The new marriage laws (especially those after
1836, which granted the right to marry to nonconformist chapels as well as
civil registrars) had the effect of making the betrothal less binding and of
sharply differentiating the married from the unmarried, hence making the
difference between licit and illicit sex more important. Earlier traditions
survived in rural areas and amongst the unorganized and disrupted working
class, but marriage became increasingly the gateway to respectability and
stability. It was buttressed by an increasing idealization of domesticity, a
growing specification and rationalization in the censure of extra-marital sex
(partly articulated by what one sex reformer called 'the continued extension of
criminal law') and by the difficulty of divorce. The 1857 Matrimonial Causes
Act, which set up secular courts and procedures, established no new principle
not involved in the old form of divorces by petitions in Acts of Parliament.
The only principle abandoned in 1857 was the propriety of making legal remedies
for marriage difficulties available for the aristocracy while withholding them
from the growing upper middle class. Change was slow: divorce rose from an
annual average of 148 in the decade after 1851 to 582 in the decade before
1900; and divorce remained a strong social stigma. Even innocent parties were
excluded from court until 1887. In the working class, though the stigma might
be less, the difficulties were even greater and divorce was quite out of the
question for most" (24-25).</p>

"The life style of the bourgeois lady was
purchased at the expense of a large class of servants, often prone to sexual
depredations, and an equally vulnerable group of prostitutes. The ideological
division of women into two classes, the virtuous and the fallen, was already
well developed by the mid-eighteenth century: its reality was to have a vivid
impact on the Victorian imagination. Nor did it go unchallenged. The
evangelical and puritan strands vigorously opposed the double standard, and by
the last decades of the century were able to pose a significant challenge to
its easy acceptance. Nonetheless, it is inescapably true that familial
ideology was accompanied by, and often relied on, a vast underbelly of
prostitution, which fed on the double standard and an authoritarian moral code"

"Sexuality thus had an extremely complex and vital symbolic role in what became the dominant ideology in the nineteenth century.  First and foremost, sexual respectability expressed the aspirations and lives of the middle class.  Only secondarily was it for export to other classes.  It is here that theorizations which see the nuclear family as a means for controlling the working class in the 'interests of capitalism' can be seen to be inadequate. . . . </p>
<p>
[D]espite . . . earnest evangelical endeavors it is probably true to say that many bourgeois groups had little direct interest in working-class morality, as long as work relationships were secured.  In the debate over the great Commissions of Inquiry of the 1830s and the 1840s, divisions amongst the bourgeoisie were quite clear.  Neither the interpretations nor the prognostications of men such as Lord Ashley were universally acceptable and the 'colonizing' efforts were largely unsuccessful. By the 1890s the seats of sexual respectablity were seen by reformers such as Grant Allen to rest in the lower middle class and the upper working class, but in the latter there was no simple acceptance of middle-class norms.  What was taking place was much more complex, and the working-class patterns of family and sexual life that were brought to the twentieth century were as much the product of working-class adaptation to rapid change in the context of a ruling set of ideas as a successful colonization.  nevertheless, the existence of this vast and strange symbolic other served to confirm the rightness, indeed righteousness, of the moral code.  It is in this context that we can appreciate the truth of Foucault's dictum that 'sexuality' was originally and fundamentally bourgeois in origins.  It was in the great middle classes that sexuality, albeit in a morally and sharply defined form, first became of major ideological significance" (32-33). </p> </div>
