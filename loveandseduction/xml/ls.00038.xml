      <head type="editorial">Scene One: Emma and Rodolphe in a Balcony Seduction</head>

<p>Rodolphe, meanwhile, with Madame Bovary, had gone up to the first
floor of the town hall, to the "council-room," and, as it was
empty, he declared that they could enjoy the sight there more
comfortably. He fetched three stools from the round table under
the bust of the monarch, and having carried them to one of the
windows, they sat down by each other.</p>

<p>There was commotion on the platform, long whisperings, much

parleying. At last the councillor got up. They knew now that his
name was Lieuvain, and in the crowd the name was passed from one
to the other. After he had collated a few pages, and bent over
them to see better, he began:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen! May I be permitted first of all (before addressing
you on the object of our meeting to-day, and this sentiment will,
I am sure, be shared by you all), may I be permitted, I say, to
pay a tribute to the higher administration, to the government to
the monarch, gentle men, our sovereign, to that beloved king, to
whom no branch of public or private prosperity is a matter of
indifference, and who directs with a hand at once so firm and
wise the chariot of the state amid the incessant perils of a
stormy sea, knowing, moreover, how to make peace respected as
well as war, industry, commerce, agriculture, and the fine arts?"</p>

<p>"I ought," said Rodolphe, "to get back a little further."</p>

<p>"Why?" said Emma.</p>

<p>But at this moment the voice of the councillor rose to an
extraordinary pitch. He declaimed:</p>

<p>"This is no longer the time, gentlemen, when civil discord
ensanguined our public places, when the landlord, the
business-man, the working-man himself, falling asleep at night,
lying down to peaceful sleep, trembled lest he should be awakened
suddenly by the noise of incendiary tocsins, when the most
subversive doctrines audaciously sapped foundations."</p>

<p>"Well, someone down there might see me," Rodolphe resumed, "then
I should have to invent excuses for a fortnight; and with my bad
reputation&#8212;"</p>

<p>"Oh, you are slandering yourself," said Emma.</p>

<p>"No! It is dreadful, I assure you."</p>

<p>"But, gentlemen," continued the councillor, "if, banishing from
my memory the remembrance of these sad pictures, I carry my eyes
back to the actual situation of our dear country, what do I see
there?  Everywhere commerce and the arts are flourishing;
everywhere new means of communication, like so many new arteries
in the body of the state, establish within it new relations. Our
great industrial centres have recovered all their activity;
religion, more consolidated, smiles in all hearts; our ports are
full, confidence is born again, and France breathes once more!"</p>

<p>"Besides," added Rodolphe, "perhaps from the world's point of
view they are right."</p>

<p>"How so?" she asked.</p>

<p>"What!" said he. "Do you not know that there are souls constantly
tormented?  They need by turns to dream and to act, the purest
passions and the most turbulent joys, and thus they fling
themselves into all sorts of fantasies, of follies."</p>

<p>Then she looked at him as one looks at a traveller who has
voyaged over strange lands, and went on:</p>

<p>"We have not even this distraction, we poor women!"</p>

<p>"A sad distraction, for happiness isn't found in it."</p>

<p>"But is it ever found?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes; one day it comes," he answered.</p>

<p>"And this is what you have understood," said the councillor.</p>

<p>"You, farmers, agricultural labourers! you pacific pioneers of a
work that belongs wholly to civilization! you, men of progress
and morality, you have understood, I say, that political storms
are even more redoubtable than atmospheric disturbances!"</p>

<p>"It comes one day," repeated Rodolphe, "one day suddenly, and
when one is despairing of it. Then the horizon expands; it is as
if a voice cried, 'It is here!' You feel the need of confiding
the whole of your life, of giving everything, sacrificing
everything to this being. There is no need for explanations; they
understand one another. They have seen each other in dreams!"
(And he looked at her.) "In fine, here it is, this treasure so
sought after, here before you. It glitters, it flashes; yet one
still doubts, one does not believe it; one remains dazzled, as if
one went out iron darkness into light."</p>

<p>And as he ended Rodolphe suited the action to the word. He passed
his hand over his face, like a man seized with giddiness. Then he
let it fall on Emma's. She took hers away.</p>

<p>"And who would be surprised at it, gentlemen?  He only who is so
blind, so plunged (I do not fear to say it), so plunged in the
prejudices of another age as still to misunderstand the spirit of
agricultural populations. Where, indeed, is to be found more
patriotism than in the country, greater devotion to the public
welfare, more intelligence, in a word?  And, gentlemen, I do not
mean that superficial intelligence, vain ornament of idle minds,
but rather that profound and balanced intelligence that applies
itself above all else to useful objects, thus contributing to the
good of all, to the common amelioration and to the support of the
state, born of respect for law and the practice of duty&#8212;"</p>

<p>"Ah! again!" said Rodolphe. "Always 'duty.' I am sick of the
word. They are a lot of old blockheads in flannel vests and of
old women with foot-warmers and rosaries who constantly drone
into our ears 'Duty, duty!' Ah! by Jove! one's duty is to feel
what is great, cherish the beautiful, and not accept all the
conventions of society with the ignominy that it imposes upon
us."</p>

<p>"Yet&#8212;yet&#8212;" objected Madame Bovary.</p>

<p>"No, no! Why cry out against the passions?  Are they not the one
beautiful thing on the earth, the source of heroism, of
enthusiasm, of poetry, music, the arts, of everything, in a
word?"</p>

<p>"But one must," said Emma, "to some extent bow to the opinion of
the world and accept its moral code."</p>

<p>"Ah! but there are two," he replied. "The small, the
conventional, that of men, that which constantly changes, that
brays out so loudly, that makes such a commotion here below, of
the earth earthly, like the mass of imbeciles you see down there.
But the other, the eternal, that is about us and above, like the
landscape that surrounds us, and the blue heavens that give us
light."</p>

<p>Monsieur Lieuvain had just wiped his mouth with a
pocket-handkerchief. He continued:</p>

<p>"And what should I do here gentlemen, pointing out to you the
uses of agriculture?  Who supplies our wants?  Who provides our
means of subsistence?  Is it not the agriculturist?  The
agriculturist, gentlemen, who, sowing with laborious hand the
fertile furrows of the country, brings forth the corn, which,
being ground, is made into a powder by means of ingenious
machinery, comes out thence under the name of flour, and from
there, transported to our cities, is soon delivered at the
baker's, who makes it into food for poor and rich alike. Again,
is it not the agriculturist who fattens, for our clothes, his
abundant flocks in the pastures?  For how should we clothe
ourselves, how nourish ourselves, without the agriculturist?  And,
gentlemen, is it even necessary to go so far for examples?  Who
has not frequently reflected on all the momentous things that we
get out of that modest animal, the ornament of poultry-yards,
that provides us at once with a soft pillow for our bed, with
succulent flesh for our tables, and eggs?  But I should never end
if I were to enumerate one after the other all the different
products which the earth, well cultivated, like a generous
mother, lavishes upon her children. Here it is the vine,
elsewhere the apple tree for cider, there colza, farther on
cheeses and flax. Gentlemen, let us not forget flax, which has
made such great strides of late years, and to which I will more
particularly call your attention."</p>

<p>He had no need to call it, for all the mouths of the multitude
were wide open, as if to drink in his words. Tuvache by his side
listened to him with staring eyes. Monsieur Derozerays from time
to time softly closed his eyelids, and farther on the chemist,
with his son Napol&#233;on between his knees, put his hand behind his
ear in order not to lose a syllable. The chins of the other
members of the jury went slowly up and down in their waistcoats
in sign of approval. The firemen at the foot of the platform
rested on their bayonets; and Binet, motionless, stood with
out-turned elbows, the point of his sabre in the air. Perhaps he
could hear, but certainly he could see nothing, because of the
visor of his helmet, that fell down on his nose. His lieutenant,
the youngest son of Monsieur Tuvache, had a bigger one, for his
was enormous, and shook on his head, and from it an end of his
cotton scarf peeped out. He smiled beneath it with a perfectly
infantine sweetness, and his pale little face, whence drops were
running, wore an expression of enjoyment and sleepiness.</p>

<p>The square as far as the houses was crowded with people. One saw
folk leaning on their elbows at all the windows, others standing
at doors, and Justin, in front of the chemist's shop, seemed
quite transfixed by the sight of what he was looking at. In spite
of the silence Monsieur Lieuvain's voice was lost in the air. It
reached you in fragments of phrases, and interrupted here and
there by the creaking of chairs in the crowd; then you suddenly
heard the long bellowing of an ox, or else the bleating of the
lambs, who answered one another at street corners. In fact, the
cowherds and shepherds had driven their beasts thus far, and
these lowed from time to time, while with their tongues they tore
down some scrap of foliage that hung above their mouths.</p>

<p>Rodolphe had drawn nearer to Emma, and said to her in a low
voice, speaking rapidly:</p>

<p>"Does not this conspiracy of the world revolt you?  Is there a
single sentiment it does not condemn?  The noblest instincts, the
purest sympathies are persecuted, slandered; and if at length two
poor souls do meet, all is so organised that they cannot blend
together. Yet they will make the attempt; they will flutter their
wings; they will call upon each other. Oh! no matter. Sooner or
later, in six months, ten years, they will come together, will
love; for fate has decreed it, and they are born one for the
other."</p>

<p>His arms were folded across his knees, and thus lifting his face
towards Emma, close by her, he looked fixedly at her. She noticed
in his eyes small golden lines radiating from black pupils; she
even smelt the perfume of the pomade that made his hair glossy.
Then a faintness came over her; she recalled the Viscount who had
waltzed with her at Vaubyessard, and his beard exhaled like this
air an odour of vanilla and citron, and mechanically she
half-closed her eyes the better to breathe it in. But in making
this movement, as she leant back in her chair, she saw in the
distance, right on the line of the horizon, the old diligence,
the "Hirondelle," that was slowly descending the hill of Leux,
dragging after it a long trail of dust. It was in this yellow
carriage that L&#233;on had so often come back to her, and by this
route down there that he had gone for ever. She fancied she saw
him opposite at his windows; then all grew confused; clouds
gathered; it seemed to her that she was again turning in the
waltz under the light of the lustres on the arm of the Viscount,
and that Leon was not far away, that he was coming; and yet all
the time she was conscious of the scent of Rodolphe's head by her
side. This sweetness of sensation pierced through her old
desires, and these, like grains of sand under a gust of wind,
eddied to and fro in the subtle breath of the perfume which
suffused her soul. She opened wide her nostrils several times to
drink in the freshness of the ivy round the capitals. She took
off her gloves, she wiped her hands, then fanned her face with
her handkerchief, while athwart the throbbing of her temples she
heard the murmur of the crowd and the voice of the councillor
intoning his phrases. He said&#8212;"Continue, persevere; listen
neither to the suggestions of routine, nor to the over-hasty
councils of a rash empiricism.</p>

<p>"Apply yourselves, above all, to the amelioration of the soil, to
good manures, to the development of the equine, bovine, ovine,
and porcine races. Let these shows be to you pacific arenas,
where the victor in leaving it will hold forth a hand to the
vanquished, and will fraternise with him in the hope of better
success. And you, aged servants, humble domestics, whose hard
labour no Government up to this day has taken into consideration,
come hither to receive the reward of your silent virtues, and be
assured that the state henceforward has its eye upon you; that it
encourages you, protects you; that it will accede to your just
demands, and alleviate as much as in it lies the burden of your
painful sacrifices."</p>

<p>Monsieur Lieuvain then sat down; Monsieur Derozerays got up,
beginning another speech. His was not perhaps so florid as that
of the councillor, but it recommended itself by a more direct
style, that is to say, by more special knowledge and more
elevated considerations. Thus the praise of the Government took
up less space in it; religion and agriculture more. He showed in
it the relations of these two, and how they had always
contributed to civilisation. Rodolphe with Madame Bovary was
talking dreams, presentiments, magnetism. Going back to the
cradle of society, the orator painted those fierce times when men
lived on acorns in the heart of woods. Then they had left off the
skins of beasts, had put on cloth, tilled the soil, planted the
vine. Was this a good, and in this discovery was there not more
of injury than of gain?  Monsieur Derozerays set himself this
problem. From magnetism little by little Rodolphe had come to
affinities, and while the president was citing Cincinnatus and
his plough, Diocletian, planting his cabbages, and the Emperors
of China inaugurating the year by the sowing of seed, the young
man was explaining to the young woman that these irresistible
attractions find their cause in some previous state of existence.</p>

<p>"Thus we," he said, "why did we come to know one another?  What
chance willed it?  It was because across the infinite, like two
streams that flow but to unite; our special bents of mind had
driven us towards each other."</p>

<p>And he seized her hand; she did not withdraw it.</p>

<p>"For good farming generally!" cried the president.</p>

<p>"Just now, for example, when I went to your house."</p>

<p>"To Monsieur Bizat of Quincampoix."</p>

<p>"Did I know I should accompany you?"</p>

<p>"Seventy francs."</p>

<p>"A hundred times I wished to go; and I followed you&#8212;I remained."</p>

<p>"Manures!"</p>

<p>"And I shall remain to-night, to-morrow, all other days, all my
life!"</p>

<p>"To Monsieur Caron of Argueil, a gold medal!"</p>

<p>"For I have never in the society of any other person found so
complete a charm."</p>

<p>"To Monsieur Bain of Givry-Saint-Martin."</p>

<p>"And I shall carry away with me the remembrance of you."</p>

<p>"For a merino ram!"</p>

<p>"But you will forget me; I shall pass away like a shadow."</p>

<p>"To Monsieur Belot of Notre-Dame."</p>

<p>"Oh, no! I shall be something in your thought, in your life,
shall I not?"</p>

<p>"Porcine race; prizes&#8212;equal, to Messrs. Leh&#233;riss&#233; and
Cullembourg, sixty francs!"</p>

<p>Rodolphe was pressing her hand, and he felt it all warm and
quivering like a captive dove that wants to fly away; but,
whether she was trying to take it away or whether she was
answering his pressure; she made a movement with her fingers. He
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Oh, I thank you! You do not repulse me! You are good! You
understand that I am yours! Let me look at you; let me
contemplate you!"</p>

<p>A gust of wind that blew in at the window ruffled the cloth on
the table, and in the square below all the great caps of the
peasant women were uplifted by it like the wings of white
butterflies fluttering.</p>

<p>"Use of oil-cakes," continued the president. He was hurrying on:</p>

<p>"Flemish manure&#8212;flax-growing&#8212;drainage&#8212;long leases&#8212;domestic
service."</p>

<p>Rodolphe was no longer speaking. They looked at one another. A
supreme desire made their dry lips tremble, and wearily, without
an effort, their fingers intertwined.</p>

<p>"Catherine Nicaise Elizabeth Leroux, of Sassetot-la-Guerri&#232;re,
for fifty-four years of service at the same farm, a silver
medal&#8212;value, twenty-five francs!"</p>

<p>"Where is Catherine Leroux?" repeated the councillor.</p>

<p>She did not present herself, and one could hear voices
whispering:</p>

<p>"Go up!"</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid!"</p>

<p>"Oh, how stupid she is!"</p>

<p>"Well, is she there?" cried Tuvache.</p>

<p>"Yes; here she is."</p>

<p>"Then let her come up!"</p>

<p>Then there came forward on the platform a little old woman with
timid bearing, who seemed to shrink within her poor clothes. On
her feet she wore heavy wooden clogs, and from her hips hung a
large blue apron. Her pale face framed in a borderless cap was
more wrinkled than a withered russet apple. And from the sleeves
of her red jacket looked out two large hands with knotty joints,
the dust of barns, the potash of washing the grease of wools had
so encrusted, roughened, hardened these that they seemed dirty,
although they had been rinsed in clear water; and by dint of long
service they remained half open, as if to bear humble witness for
themselves of so much suffering endured. Something of monastic
rigidity dignified her face. Nothing of sadness or of emotion
weakened that pale look. In her constant living with animals she
had caught their dumbness and their calm. It was the first time
that she found herself in the midst of so large a company, and
inwardly scared by the flags, the drums, the gentlemen in
frock-coats, and the order of the councillor, she stood
motionless, not knowing whether to advance or run away, nor why
the crowd was pushing her and the jury were smiling at her.
Thus stood before these radiant bourgeois this half-century of
servitude.</p>

<p>"Approach, venerable Catherine Nicaise Elizabeth Leroux!" said
the councillor, who had taken the list of prize-winners from the
president; and, looking at the piece of paper and the old woman
by turns, he repeated in a fatherly tone&#8212;"Approach! approach!"</p>

<p>"Are you deaf?" said Tuvache, fidgeting in his armchair; and he
began shouting in her ear, "Fifty-four years of service. A silver
medal! Twenty-five francs! For you!"</p>

<p>Then, when she had her medal, she looked at it, and a smile of
beatitude spread over her face; and as she walked away they could
hear her muttering "I'll give it to our cure up home, to say some
masses for me!"</p>

<p>"What fanaticism!" exclaimed the chemist, leaning across to the
notary.</p>

<p>The meeting was over, the crowd dispersed, and now that the
speeches had been read, each one fell back into his place again,
and everything into the old grooves; the masters bullied the
servants, and these struck the animals, indolent victors, going
back to the stalls, a green-crown on their horns.</p>

<p>The National Guards, however, had gone up to the first floor of
the town hall with buns spitted on their bayonets, and the
drummer of the battalion carried a basket with bottles. Madame
Bovary took Rodolphe's arm; he saw her home; they separated at
her door; then he walked about alone in the meadow while he
waited for the time of the banquet.</p>
