            <head>1. </head><p>"Some northerners dreamed that a disciplined and
chastened America would emerge from the fires of the Civil War. But those
venturing to New York City saw the opposite: a seeming explosion of
sensationalism and sexual display. Caught up in this changing world, readers sought
help in understanding sexuality and their own sexual natures. New books on
phrenology and physiological reform aimed to instruct them. These were now
more various and included works that articulated the fourth framework, which
placed sex at the core of life, introduced through utopian movements,
Spiritualism, and free love. Yet even as readers sought new information,
forces of suppression threatened to curtail it. The obscenity conviction of
Simon Landis for selling a book of reform physiology was a harbinger of changes
to come: changes in law and the courts that would abridge Americans' freedom
to publish &#8212; and therefore read &#8212; works offering sexual knowledge" (319).</p></div>
<div>

         <head>2. </head><p>"In the late 1860s and early 1870s, weekly
publications emanating from the city highlighted the racy features of New York
sporting life and broadcast them to the broader society. By then George W.
Matsell was the editor of the <hi rend="italic">National Police Gazette...</hi>Under his
direction, the <hi rend="italic">National Police Gazette </hi>took on a more dramatic look. The
technology and style of illustrations meant more exciting visuals emphasizing
moments of violence, often linked with sexual crimes from across the
nation...Ministerial misdeeds from many sections of the country formed a clear
subgroup of articles, and readers learned about men of the cloth who taught
masturbation to the young or murdered their wives" (322-23).</p></div>

        <div> <head>3. </head><p>"By the late 1860s, the <hi rend="italic">National Police Gazette
</hi>had a competitor in Frank Leslie's weekly, <hi rend="italic">Days' Doings. </hi>Leslie had
several publications appealing to children, <hi rend="italic">Budget of Fun, Chimney Corner, </hi>and
<hi rend="italic">Boys' &amp; Girls'. </hi>The subtitle of the <hi rend="italic">Days' Doings </hi>suggests
its different emphasis: "Illustrating Current Events of Romance, Police
Reports, Important Trials, and Sporting News." Although covering some of the
ground of the <hi rend="italic">National Police Gazette, </hi>the <hi rend="italic">Days' Doings </hi>primarily
promised and delivered salacious gossip about the theatrical world" (323).</p>
