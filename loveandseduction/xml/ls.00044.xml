         <p>WHAT
the speaker most feared was an encounter between the young men &#8212; a thing to be
avoided at any risk: not that Edward Howard lacked animal courage &#8212; he was too
proud for that; proud men are seldom cowards. It was his grandfather who
trembled for the result, not he. A shot well aimed, and in an instant the
schemes and toils of years were baffled.</p>

         <p>"No,"
he muttered, "that must be prevented at any risk."</p>

         <p>A few nights
after Hanway's interview with Mendez and his grandson, Gus, Frank
Wilton, and a party of officers adjourned from the mess-table to the Gran
Teatro. The Senora Pascata appeared in Spontini's opera of <hi rend="italic">The Vestal</hi>; never had the passionate, frail priestess of Vesta found a more beautiful or
intellectual representative; her energy and wild despair, when the sacred fire
was extinguished was terrific. But the last act was the climax of her triumph.
The guilty vestal is entombed alive;
just as she is expiring with famine, the massive vault is broken in, and her lover, at the head of his
legion, arrives to rescue her.</p>

         <p>Poor Gus, who had never before witnessed
the representation of a lyrical drama, was excited to the highest degree of
enthusiasm: the look of love contending with the agony of death &#8212; the triumph
of finding the man for whom she had sacrificed herself true to her &#8212; were admirably
depicted by the <hi rend="italic">artiste</hi>, who, at the fall of the curtain, was twice
recalled by the enthusiastic audience, and retired each time amid a shower of
bouquets and bravo.</p>

         <p>As
the actress left the scene the last time her eyes encountered those of Gus
fixed with intense admiration upon her expressive countenance: the glance seemed
to slightly trouble her. Her eyelids fell as she reached the wing; either by
coquetry or design she raised them for an instant, and the heart of our hero
was on fire. His companions laughingly congratulated him upon his conquest.</p>

         <p>"Ridiculous!"
he said, blushing deeply; "the regard was merely accidental."</p>

         <p>"Accidental!"
repeated Frank Wilton. "My dear fellow, such accidents look very much like
design. I would give a month's pay, which, <hi rend="italic">par parenth&#232;se</hi>," he added,
"I have never yet touched, "that the <hi rend="italic">belle</hi> vestal had favoured
me with such a glance."</p>

         <p>His
friend remained silent; but during the rest of the evening he thought of Senora
Pascata &#8212; he even dreamt of her instead of Minnie; a treason which, however it
may be blamed by our readers of the gentler sex, will be looked upon with a
more lenient eye by their brothers and lovers.</p>

         <p>I
am afraid that men, after all, are naturally inconstant, especially at twenty:
Nature has formed the heart of such impressionable stuff, a lovely form is sure
to leave its image.</p>

         <p>Perhaps
it is a question for casuists to decide, whether women do not share the sin of
man's inconstancy: were they less beautiful, we should be less fickle. Of
course we do not mean to insinuate
that they share it in any other sense &#8212; gallantry forbids. Heigho! What says
experience?</p>

         <p>The
next day Gus, took occasion to inquire of a Portuguese gentleman, with whom he
had become acquainted some particulars of the history of Senora Pascata - from
a sentiment of curiosity, as he observed &#8212; of course nothing more.</p>

         <p>"I
need not tell you she is beautiful," replied the person to whom he had
addressed himself &#8212; "your eyes have convinced you of that &#8212; or talented. I
saw you at the last representation of <hi rend="italic">The Vestal</hi>. She is one of those strange compounds," he added, "which defy description. She has ruined the
fortunes of half the young fellows of Lisbon; but she has her caprices. Would
you believe it, the Infant Don Pedro, previous to his departure for Brazil, courted her three months in vain?  If you value your happiness, avoid her."</p>

         <p>For two days our hero tried to forget the being who had so fascinated his attention; and imagined that he had succeeded, because he did not converse about her. The next night he suffered himself to be entrapped to a <hi rend="italic">bal masque</hi>, at the Opera. Like the whole of his brother officers, he was in uniform. As he entered the portico of the theatre, his attention was struck by a sister of mercy, who,
in the costume of the order, was leaning against one of the columns. The
capuchin prevented his seeing her face; but there was something which attracted
him in the figure &#8212; he fancied he had seen it before. Before he had time to
remember when or where, the crowd of masks and visitors compelled him to
proceed; and in the brilliant scene which met his gaze in the interior of the
Opera House the solitary nun was quickly forgotten.</p>

         <p>We pity the man who has not been at a masquerade at least once in his life.
Remember, we do not advise it twice. A masquerade is an epitome of the world,
in which the different nations are passed in review; it is a scene of joy, excitement,
tumult, passion, dissipation, languor, fatigue, disgust.</p>

         <p>Gus,
who had only arrived at the second stage, had purposely separated himself from
his companions, in order to analyse the various sensations as they presented
themselves. He had been several minutes occupied in regarding a group of
dancers, when a hand was laid upon his shoulder.</p>

         <p>He started,and turned.</p>

         <p>A female in
the costume of a gipsy &#8212; such as is generally worn by the wandering Bohemians
of Spain and Portugal &#8212; was by his side. Masses of long, curling hair fell open
her neck and shoulders, but her countenance was effectively concealed by a
velvet mask. A scarlet petticoat, sufficiently short to display a well-turned
ankle, a dark boddice and gaudily striped mantle, completed the dress of the
fair intruder.</p>

         <p>"You must be an
Englishman?" she said.</p>

         <p>"Why so?" demanded
the young man, with a smile.</p>

         <p>"Because none but an
Englishman, in a scene like this, would stop to analyse the nature of his
pleasures whilst the essence escaped him."</p>

         <p>Gus felt suddenly
interested. He knew not why, but there was something in the tone of the
speaker's voice which made his heart vibrate. Besides, he had felt her hand
tremble as she laid it upon his arm.</p>

         <p>"It is the first
time," he observed, "that I ever assisted at such a scene. No wonder that I am
bewildered."</p>

         <p>"And if you are
wise," said the unknown, with a sigh, "it will be the last."</p>

         <p>"Why the last?"</p>

         <p>"Because, with
everything to excite the senses, there is nothing to occupy the heart."</p>

         <p>"And yet you are here?" observed the young man.</p>

         <p>"It is the privilege
of sorrow," hastily interrupted the mask, "to drown woe by every means within
its reach. Perhaps I am here," she added, "with the intention of doing good."</p>

         <p>"I do not understand you," said Gus.</p>

         <p>"My dress," continued the lady, pointing to her gipsy costume, "entitles me to be oracular &#8212; to warn the heedless."</p>

         <p>"You are too young to
act the part of Mentor; you more resemble Calypso."</p>

         <p>There was more truth
than the speaker imagined in the observation, which in the simplicity of his
heart, was intended for a compliment, but which was felt as an epigram.</p>

         <p>The fair mask sighed,
and was about to retire.</p>

         <p>"Stay &#8212; pray stay!"
exclaimed our hero, struck by the glance of a pair of beautiful dark eyes fixed
reproachfully upon him. He had seen those eyes before, and felt that it was
impossible he could be mistaken. "I have offended you?"</p>

         <p>"I have no right to feel offended," was the sad reply.</p>

         <p>"And
yet you leave me!" he urged. "Oh! If I dared, I would entreat of you to be
my companion, my guide in this motley scene."</p>

         <p>"Men
dare everything under a mask," replied the unknown; "it is worn as frequently
in real life as in a carnival."</p>

         <p>"You accept, then?"</p>

         <p>"I accept."</p>

         <p>The
gipsy, with a frankness well suited to the character she had assumed, took the
arm of the young man, and commenced with him a tour of the theatre. It was
impossible not to be struck by the brilliant tone of her conversation &#8212; the
extraordinary powers of observation her mind displayed. Statesmen, nobles,
generals, were rapidly passed in review &#8212; their foibles or qualities hit off
with an unsparing hand.</p>

         <p>"You
seem to know every one," observed Gus; "but there is one celebrity whom I would
fain become acquainted with, whom you have not named &#8212; one whose genius has
delighted me, whose beauty has captivated me."</p>

         <p>The arm of the mask trembled.</p>

         <p>"I am sure," added the speaker, "you could paint her portrait delightfully."</p>

         <p>"Her name?"</p>

         <p>"Senora Pascata."</p>

         <p>"And
do you really wish to know her?" demanded the gipsy.</p>

         <p>"More
than I ever desired to become acquainted with any woman yet. I am sure her
mind must be noble, and her heart generous: mine longs to tell her so."</p>

         <p>His
companion slowly raised her mask: the idol of the opera &#8212; the subject of his
dreams &#8212; Senora Pascata, stood beside him.</p>

         <p>"The
vestal!" murmured Gus, gazing on her with eyes eloquent with passion.</p>

         <p>A
smile, half of triumph and half of sadness, lit the countenance of the
beautiful creature; who, in the midst of vice and degradation, still retained
some portion of the angel in her nature.</p>

         <p>"I see you remember me," she whispered.</p>

         <p>"Remember
you!" repeated the youth; "from the moment I beheld you, to the present hour,
your image has not been divorced from my heart: it has haunted my pillow 
&#8212;accompanied me like my shadow in my waking hours. How happy must he be," he
added, with a sigh, "who wins the love of such a woman!"</p>

         <p>"Words
&#8212; words!" exclaimed the syren; "I have listened to them often, and once
believed them. Man's love is like his nature, selfish and inconstant; woman's,
the creature of sense, credulous and trusting. And what is her recompense? 
Oblivion. Like a thoughtless prodigal, she lavishes the rich treasure of her
affections, and meets in return contempt &#8212; neglect &#8212; indifference!" </p>

         <p>"All men are not so."</p>

         <p>"All
whom I have known," interrupted the senora, with a sigh. "But come!" she
added, "be frank; you wished to see the admired actress nearer, divested of the
interest of the scene, as men desire to observe some cunning work of art, or
strange caprice of nature. You have mistaken curiosity for interest &#8212; a
passing admiration for a tender passion. Such is not the love I seek.
Farewell!"</p>

         <p>One
of the closest observers of nature has observed how prodigal the soul is when
passion prompts. Poor Gus! &#8212; he was only twenty, so we trust our readers will
not be too severe in judging him &#8212; was fascinated by the singular beauty and
original turn of mind of the speaker. In the excitement of the moment the
image of Minnigrey was forgotten, not displaced from its temple in his heart.
With an eloquence which astonished even himself, he vindicated the nature of
his sentiments, protested his sincerity, and implored her to remain.</p>

         <p>"Let
me gaze upon you!" he said. "even if you condemn me to silence; words should
not offend which spring from the heart."</p>

         <p>There
was something novel in the mingled boyish timidity and manly energy of the
young soldier, which most probably recalled to the senora some tender
recollection of the past; for her countenance became troubled, she shrank from
the task she had undertaken, and yet a fatal necessity compelled her to pursue
it. She had much rather that her destined victim had approached her with the
stale flattery &#8212; the lip homage &#8212; she had so often listened to and despised.
There was a freshness in his admiration &#8212; a respect in his passion &#8212; which
touched her; and for the first time in years she experienced a pang of remorse.</p>

         <p>"You
are young in the character you have undertaken," she observed, "and recite your
lesson with an air of truthfulness which might deceive a less experienced
actress than myself."</p>

         <p>"By
heavens you wrong me!" exclaimed our hero. "I love &#8212; "</p>

         <p>"Love!" interrupted Pascata; "ay, as most men
love, but not as I understand it. What love can exist between one of my
profession and the proud young English noble?"</p>

         <p>"There, again, you are in error," observed Gus,
with a smile. "Like you, I have risen from the ranks of the people. I owe my
commission to my sword, and not to birth or fortune."</p>

         <p>The actress regarded him with increased
interest: there was something noble in the pride which repudiated adventitious
means of success, and relied on its own energies.</p>

         <p>"Sprung from the people, too!" she murmured;
"and I &#8212; "</p>

         <p>The rest of the phrase died upon her lips; it
was evident that a struggle was taking place between her evil and her better
nature.</p>

         <p>"At least," she said, "we will not separate yet;
the motley scene is new to you; I will be your guide."</p>

         <p>It were needless to say that our hero eagerly
agreed; and offering his arm to the speaker, who resumed her mask, they made
the tour of the brilliant assembly together.</p>

         <p>The influence which a clever woman exercises
over the mind of a young man uninitiated in the deceits and maneuvers of the
world, is good or ill in proportion as the character of the female is elevated
or base. There is a spell in her smile which youth seldom can resist, and
which even age but rarely guards against. The observations of the actress were
full of tact and finesse. Gus was fascinated; and yet at times he detected an
under current of scorn and bitterness which startled him. In his simplicity,
he could not understand how one so young and beautiful could have been led to
analyse so deeply that mystery of all mysteries &#8212; the human heart.</p>

         <p>Fixing his eyes upon her, he observed, in a tone
of regret, that she must have suffered much.</p>

         <p>"Why should you think so?" demanded the senora.</p>

         <p>"From your words."</p>

         <p>"True," said the actress; "illusion after
illusion has vanished, and yet fresh illusions," she added, with a smile, "take
their place. Youth is but a change of dreams; those only are happy who die
before they wake!"</p>

         <p>"It is a sad thought."</p>

         <p>"And yet a true one," she continued. "Look on
me &#8212; men call me beautiful."</p>

         <p>"And you are beautiful!" interrupted Gus, gazing
on her with passionate tenderness; "beautiful not only in person but in genius
 beautiful in that intellectual grace &#8212; "</p>

         <p>"Which is bought by suffering," observed La
Pascata, as she was generally called in Lisbon. &#8212; "Would you believe it&#8212; my
success as an <hi rend="italic">artiste, </hi>which was coldly brilliant while I was happy, has
become an enthusiasm with the public since I have been wretched. As I grew
indifferent to the plaudits of the crowd, they redoubled; my admirers became
worshippers!"</p>
 <p>"I think I can understand you," observed our hero.</p>

         <p>His companion regarded him with an inquiring
eye.</p>

         <p>"Genius in some natures is like the perfume of
certain flowers: it must be crushed before the gift appears!"</p>

         <p>The actress bent her head. Had not the mask
concealed her features, her companion would have seen that her brilliant eyes
were dimmed with tears.</p>

         <p>"True," she murmured; then suddenly raising her
head, and shaking the cloud of clustering curls from her brow, she added, "Our
conversation is too dull for a scene like this, where pleasure reigns. The
orchestra is sounding for a waltz. You are a strange caballero &#8212; you have not
yet invited me to dance."</p>

         <p>The hint was not thrown away. The next minute
saw our hero with his arm, which trembled with passionate emotion, twined round
the form of the syren, whose graceful movements, as her fairy feet fell to the
lively measure, excited the admiration of all present.</p>

         <p>What a glorious thing is youth! Full of warm
confidence, high hopes, and generous feelings, flowing from the heart like a
gush of music from an angel's harp. How keen are its enjoyments, how novel its
sensations, how exquisite its appreciation of the true and beautiful! </p>

         <lg type="poem">
	<l>Pity the world should ever wake</l>

	<l>The young heart from so fair a vision,</l>

         <l>Or time the rosy fetters break</l>

         <l>Which hold it in that gentle prison.</l>
		</lg>

         <p>But so unfortunately it is! With time we begin to analyse
our sensations, examine the petals of the flower, and let the odour escape,
till, one by one, the leaves fade and fall, and the withered stem alone is left
in the gazer's hand.</p>

         <p>Fortunately for our hero, he had not reached
that sad period of existence. His heart was still as young as hope, as
passionate as love. He saw in the gifted being by his side the ideal realized,
read in her dark, melting eyes that he was not indifferent to her. Happy in
the intoxication of the moment, he neither thought nor inquired further.</p>

         <p>It was nearly day-break when he left the
ballroom. As he conducted La Pascata to her carriage, he was struck by the
appearance of the sister of mercy whom he had noticed on his arrival. She was
still leaning against the column at the entrance, her capuchin drawn over her
countenance. As the vehicle drove off, she rushed forward, as if urged by some
irresistible impulse. It was too late &#8212; the horses had started. Pressing her
hand upon her heart, as if to control its emotion, she slowly disappeared down
the Strada d' Alcantra.</p>

         <p>Wilton, who had watched the proceedings of his
friend, left the joyous scene at the same time. The act of the sister surprised
him. He noticed her emotion with anxiety, and as propriety did not allow of
his following Gus, he determined to keep the <hi rend="italic">religieuse </hi>in view. He had
not pursued her many yards when, hearing a footstep, she suddenly turned, and,
with the air of a person who fears to be recognized, drew the white linen veil
yet closer over her features.</p>

         <p>"In mask, fair sister?" said Frank.</p>

         <p>"Ay," said the nun, with a sigh, "even as the
shroud is the mask of death."</p>

         <p>The deep tone of sadness struck the young
soldier forcibly. It was in vain that he tried to catch a glimpse of her
countenance &#8212; the screen was impenetrable. </p>

         <p>"You are the friend," she observed, "of the
young officer who has just left the ballroom with &#8212; with that woman?"</p>

         <p>"True."</p>

         <p>"And you love him?"</p>

         <p>"As my own brother," replied Frank Wilton. "But
why these questions?"</p>

         <p>"Because his honor and his life are both in
peril. Nay, start not," she added, "nor think that words are the idle
pleasantry of a light heart. It is long since a smile was seen upon the lips
which warn you of his danger. If you wish to save him, follow him to the hotel
of La Pascata &#8212; you see I know her name &#8212; and do not lose sight of him for an instant."</p>

         <p>"And what can I say to excuse such an
indiscretion?" demanded the young man, undecided in his own mind whether the
speaker merely sought to disembarrass herself to the intruder, or that the
warning was real.</p>

         <p>"Friendship," replied the nun, "needs no excuse
when those we love are in danger. Do you still hesitate? Reflect. Ask yourself
if your friend has not a bitter, uncompromising enemy."</p>

         <p>"True. But &#8212; "</p>

         <p>"But," impatiently repeated the <hi rend="italic">religieuse, </hi>"Oh,
the cold calculating hesitation of man! Listen," she said, "and be convinced."</p>

         <p>Approaching Frank Wilton, she laid her hand upon
his arm, and whispered in his ear the name of Hanway and the words Casa Giulio;
then satisfied that her warning was no longer disbelieved, she walked slowly
on.</p>

         <p>"Stay!" exclaimed the young man, deeply
agitated. "You have indeed pronounced names of dreadful import. One word more."</p>

         <p>"Not one."</p>

         <p>"Where lives the Senora Pascata ?"</p>

         <p>"Strada Nuova. And now away," she
added; "I have done my duty, do not neglect yours."</p>

         <p>The next moment the sister of mercy disappeared
down the street which led to the convent of her order.</p>

         <p>When Gus arrived at the hotel of the senora, and
had handed her from the carriage, the lady bade him good night, with a half-mocking,
half-relenting smile upon her lips.</p>

         <p>"And must I bid you good night?" he said, imploringly.
"Consider how late the hour, and that I have half the city to traverse before I
arrive at my quarters."</p>

         <p>"Would you have asked that question," demanded
the actress, "of the daughter of the Governor of Lisbon, or one of the titled
dames of the court?  No. I perceive," she added, haughtily, "that you mistake me
for one of those whose cheek knows no blush, whose brow no shame. You are
mistaken. It is possible I might be won, but not for the mere asking, senor.</p>

         <p>It was our hero's first adventure, and he was
timid; an experienced libertine would have found a thousand reasons. Gus only
faltered an excuse, and asked, in requital of his obedience; to be permitted to
call upon her in the morning. The request was readily granted; and, raising the
hand of the syren to his lips, he bade her good night.</p>

         <p>The actress entered the hotel with a slow step
and heavy heart. She began to regret the part she had undertaken. There was
something in the freshness of the young man's feelings and respectful manner
which touched her. A second time she murmured to herself, as she mounted the
staircase, "Sprung from the people, too."</p>

         <p>For her it was the link in the chain of sympathy
between them.</p>
