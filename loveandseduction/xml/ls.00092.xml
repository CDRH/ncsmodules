         <head>1. </head><p>"The English upper classes were sexually
permissive throughout the nineteenth century, not (as is often suggested) only
in the Regency period; and women generally expected the same sexual freedom as
men after they were married. What changed during the century was that they
became much more discreet about it. The Regency aristocracy did as they
liked: as Dorothy Marshall wrote, 'Indifference to the pain of others and
sexual laxity were accompanied by a verbal coarseness and frank acceptance of
bodily functions which the middle class of the time, and late generations,
found deeply shocking (Marshall, <hi rend="italic">Industrial England, 1776-1851 </hi>(1973))'"(89).</p></div>
<div>

         <head>2. </head><p>"The most widely read of all foreign authors in
England (except perhaps Goethe) was the French writer George Sand, though the
middle class was afraid of her neutral presentation of free, in the sense of
illicit, love. By the 1840s free love in England was associated in the public
mind with Bohemian circles. Bohemians, originally meaning gypsies, had come to
mean 'those of Society who lived outside society'. There were rumours and much
speculation about the 'Phalanstery' at Royal Hill House, Queen's road,
Bayswater, where in the 1840s George Henry Lewes and his wife Agnes were said
to have lived in a co-operative household run on Fourieresque principles with
the Thornton Hunts, the Gliddons, and the Samuel Laurences. The writer Eliza
Lynn Linton was introduced to the Phalanstery when she came to London in 1840, but she did not describe the arrangements in detail. She wrote, 

         <q rend="block">At the time I first knew these
people they were living in a kind of family communion that was very remarkable.
Sisters and cousins and brother &#8212; some of the women married, and with
yearly increasing families to which they devoted themselves; others single and of
general domestic utility all round &#8212; clubbed together their individuality and
their resources and made a kind of family.</q>

         The lack of convincing evidence about sexual relations
between the members of the commune makes it difficult to know whether free love
was practiced or not" (215).</p>
