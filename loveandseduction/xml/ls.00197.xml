<head>Scene Three:  Charles tells Eug&#233;nie of his impending departure in the garden</head>

<p>When the two lovers were alone in the garden, Charles said to Eug&#233;nie,
drawing her down on the old bench beneath the walnut-tree,&#8212;</p>

<p>"I did right to trust Alphonse; he has done famously. He has managed
my affairs with prudence and good faith. I now owe nothing in Paris.
All my things have been sold; and he tells me that he has taken the
advice of an old sea-captain and spent three thousand francs on a
commercial outfit of European curiosities which will be sure to be in
demand in the Indies. He has sent my trunks to Nantes, where a ship is
loading for San Domingo. In five days, Eug&#233;nie, we must bid each other
farewell&#8212;perhaps forever, at least for years. My outfit and ten
thousand francs, which two of my friends send me, are a very small
beginning. I cannot look to return for many years. My dear cousin, do
not weight your life in the scales with mine; I may perish; some good
marriage may be offered to you&#8212;"</p>

<p>"Do you love me?" she said.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! indeed, yes!" he answered, with a depth of tone that
revealed an equal depth of feeling.</p>

<p>"I shall wait, Charles&#8212;Good heavens! there is my father at his
window," she said, repulsing her cousin, who leaned forward to kiss
her.</p>

<p>She ran quickly under the archway. Charles followed her. When she saw
him, she retreated to the foot of the staircase and opened the
swing-door; then, scarcely knowing where she was going, Eug&#233;nie reached
the corner near Nanon's den, in the darkest end of the passage. There
Charles caught her hand and drew her to his heart. Passing his arm
about her waist, he made her lean gently upon him. Eug&#233;nie no longer
resisted; she received and gave the purest, the sweetest, and yet,
withal, the most unreserved of kisses.</p>

<p>"Dear Eug&#233;nie, a cousin is better than a brother, for he can marry
you," said Charles.</p>

<p>"So be it!" cried Nanon, opening the door of her lair.</p>

<p>The two lovers, alarmed, fled into the hall, where Eug&#233;nie took up her
work and Charles began to read the litanies of the Virgin in Madame
Grandet's prayer-book.</p>
