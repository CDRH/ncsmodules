      <field name="text">1. "....Between 1857 and 1914 adultery was . . .
         everywhere in English print culture: it was discussed in parliamentary debates;
         it was a front-page 'Divorce Court' story in most of the daily newspapers at
         least twice a week for over fifty years; it was a topic of heated discussion in
         literary and cultural interest reviews; it was represented in popular novels,
         and it was a central feature of novels that were eventually canonized as 'great'"
         (1).2. "....a common misconception prevails that a 'censorship of sex' was in place and that talking about sex was, therefore,
         an act of contestation.  Foucault's comments on the tension between the theoretical invisibility of sexuality and its visibility
         in practice correspond closely to what I have witnessed in Victorian interpretations of adultery:  a discursive explosion
         of representations of
         adultery exists alongside claims that adultery and the representation of
         adultery were nonexistent and that any attempt at representation was,
         therefore, rare and dangerously transgressive." (3).
