      <field name="text">1."Another form of reading available to Dorcas [Dorcas Doyen; later pseudonymously known as "Helen Jewett"] during her Augusta
         [Maine] years was the . . . Maine Patriot and Gazette. . . . In its brief five-year publication run (1827 to 1831), it frequently
         carried amusing essays and small news items on love, courtship, marriage, and the relations between the sexes in general.
         The very first issue of the Patriot and Gazette, for example, carried an original article titled 'The Influence of Novels
         and Romances on the Morals.' . . .  The author argued that novels, and especially historical fictions, were eminently suitable
         reading because it was possible to learn 'profitable lessons' from characterizations of fictional people, both the good—like
         the chivalrous Richard I and the bad—for example, the 'licentious profligacy of Charles II.'  Novels 'vivify the imagination
         . . . they tend to raise the spirits' and present 'human nature in its liveliest colours,' all features to be admired.  Of
         course, some novels were admitted to be 'pernicious' in their effect—Fielding, Rochester, and Smollett were singled out as
         perhaps dangerous.  But Richardson, Socott, and Irving got the seal of approval as being both educational and simply good
         to read.  The use of the authors' last names alone shows that the Maine newspaper expected its Augusta readers to be familiar
         with the works in question, even as [it] acknowledged that controversy existed over the propriety of reading them.Over the
         months, the weekly Patriot embellished its columns with small articlees on personal advice for navigating the world of relationships
         between the sexes. . . . A November 1827 article on matrimony declared that the happiest marriages occurred when 'the contracting
         parties were of a condition nearly equal; so that when the first ardours of love are abated by time, neither can assume a
         superiority, or think it a condescention [sic] to have acceded to the nuptial alliance.'  The servant Dorcas would not have
         found this advice encouraging; a girl with designs on someone in her employer's class might have read it as a rebuke or a
         timely reminder to a young man in danger of taking such a girl too seriously. . . ." 2."The Patriot's youthful focus on courtship
         and marriage articles could have helped a young girl from Maine backcountry
         understand the mores and expectations for courting behavior among young men and
         women of the Augusta elite. The Patriot approved of women's
         outrageously wide shoulders and blousy sleeves of fashionable dress; it took
         its readers on a tour or 'Peep into the Seraglio,' the harem of sultans. The
         paper made a bid for laughs with slightly suggestive stories, like one about a
         misunderstanding between a Frenchman and an American girl over the phrase 'be
         easy,' taken for 'baiser' (to kiss) by the man, or another titled 'Flirtation,'
         with characters Edmund Weston and Helen Clapp. They even referred to a poem
         about 'Black Sal, or Dusky Sally,' the alleged slave paramour of Thomas
         Jefferson of forty years before—and this in a Democratic paper, the party
         claiming to be heir to the party of Jefferson. The paper reflected a playful
         1820s sensibility about courtship, friendship, and romance: suggestive but not
         ribald, upholding good morals but without being prudish in the least.Even direct curiosity about sex
         could be tastefully handled, the paper demonstrated. In August 1828 the Patriot
         advertised a traveling lecture show that would teach young Augustans the
         fundamentals of sex and reproduction. Dr. Williams's 'anatomical preparations
         in wax' of the human body could be seen at the Masonic Hall on Water Street
         from eight in the morning until four in the afternoon—seen by men only, that
         is. There was a Mrs. Williams too, and she presented the waxed figures to a
         ladies-only audience, between four and seven in the evening. Admission for
         this diverting and edifying entertainment was twenty-five cents" (172-76).3."Newspaper of the 1820s and 1830s, including the
         Patriot,
         routinely covered one other form of news about sex: court cases over
         breach of promise suits, culled from other newspapers in distant
         jurisdictions. (Civil suits over seduction were much less common but no less
         interesting to readers.) Such news items were usually just small snippets of a
         story, a column inch or two, telling the two most essential points—how the
         fellow deserted the girl and how much she recovered in the way of damages. For
         example, in February 1829 the Patriot ran an item from a Boston paper about a Wayne County, New York, girl, pregnant and jilted
         on her wedding
         day. The jury awarded her $500, somewhat on the low side for successful
         suits. From such stories, uncommonly enacted in the courts but widely
         reprinted in the press, young men and women in the throes of courtship learned
         about the substantial costs of transgressive behavior. Pregnant brides could
         wind up deserted; grooms on the lam could be out anywhere from $500 to $1,500.In September 1828 the Patriot carried
         a small notice of a New York City civil action for breach of promise, involving
         a clerk who courted his landlady's daughter for seven years and then suddenly
         married another. The jury awarded the aggrieved girl $1,500. A much fuller
         account of the same story appeared in the Hallowell paper, the American
         Advocate . . . . The Advocate reported that the clerk was seventeen, the
         girl fifteen, when the courtship began. Seven years later the clerk married
         another, and his lawyer argued on his behalf that any man can be a victim of
         the 'uncontrollable nature of true love'; when 'passion touches his breast...he
         does not look into Blackstone.' The lawyer was William Price, one of Richard
         Robinson's lawyers in 1836, when he would again defend a New York clerk charged
         with an offense against a lover. In the 1828 trial, Price took the line that a
         young man was entitled to marital passion and happiness, and that having
         suddenly found it with a new woman, he was right to abandon the old love—in
         fact, to marry the first girl knowing he did not love her would have been a
         disservice to her. The lawyer for the young woman countered by saying that
         Lawyer Price, a bachelor, had no understanding of marriage; when the defendant
         put a ring on the plaintiff's finger and whispered in her ear (what, it
         apparently mattered not), clearly a pledge of marriage had been made. He
         appealed to the men of the jury, all married, to consider the obligations of
         engagement; the plaintiff had even tended the defendant in illness, a gesture
         of service presumably denoting an expected return. Thus a circumstantial
         promise of marriage was confirmed, and the jury found for the young woman. How
         the young clerk, now twenty-four, managed to come up with the enormous $1,500
         fine is nowhere part of the record" (176-77).4."Seduction suits were an old and, until the 1820s,
         a largely underutilized feature of English common law. Under strict
         application of the law, fathers, masters, or guardians of seduced women could
         bring a tort action under trespass law to recover damages for loss of service.
         The key idea was loss of service and attendant damage to a man's property in a
         woman: a seduction allegedly undermined ability to perform duties to parent or
         master. Pregnancy was not essential to the action, but it did increase both
         the credibility of the plaintiff's case (in proving the sexual intercourse had
         taken place) and the prospect of recovering demonstrable expenses and damages.
         Under the traditional grounds for the suit, the complicity of the girl in the
         intercourse was immaterial, oddly enough; this was a legal dispute between
         men. If a father or master encouraged a romance, say, by permitting bundling
         to occur—night courting in a bed alone—then it was difficult to persuade a
         judge to award damages.Seduction suits surged in popularity in the
         early nineteenth century. In the years between 1815 and 1830, courts
         increasingly entertained cases of jilted brides and desolate or pregnant lovers
         and began to award fairly hefty damages, typically from five hundred dollars to
         two thousand dollars. Judges often remarked in their opinions that they were
         departing from the old fictions of lost service and were really compensating
         women and their families for loss of reputation, emotional damage, and lowered
         marriage chances. Women were now construed to be the victims of seduction, not
         complicit participants" (184).5."Stories and novels featuring seduction plots
         gained renewed popularity in the early nineteenth century, featuring women
         victims who typically suffered from madness or death after lustful men ruined
         them. In a case of life imitating art, seduction suits in court reinforced the
         message; large sums of money measured a woman's ruination. Both law cases and
         seduction fictions accorded an increased value to female virginity. Underlying
         both was an assumption that women's sexual desires were not nearly as strong as
         men's; a belief in women's general 'passionlessness' took hold. Seduction
         happened because of male lust and female innocence; women's lower sexual energy
         effectively diminished their responsibility for sex.The illogical part in this formulation was that
         the presumed innocent victim, the passionless woman, bore the brunt of the
         social punishment. But at the same time, it was an effective formulation: it
         gave the party thought to be least likely to succumb to sexual temptation the
         extra motivation to put the brakes on any illicit behavior. The outcome of
         irreparable damage to a woman's reputation and prospects powerfully discouraged
         her from agreeing to illicit sex" (200-01).
