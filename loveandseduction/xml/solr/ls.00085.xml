         "It has frequently but erroneously been
         stated that divorce was originally introduced in England by the Matrimonial
         Causes Act of 1857. In fact this legislation did not alter the law of divorce
         in any way but simply made it subject to judicial process, thus making it
         quicker, cheaper and more widely available than the existing cumbrous procedure
         by Private Act of Parliament. . . While altering the procedure for obtaining a
         divorce, the 1857 Act introduced no new principles. . . . However, it did result in the reporting of the
         evidence in divorce cases, often in salacious detail. This caused Queen Victoria considerable concern, and after the judicial
         court had been hearing divorce
         petitions for about two years the Queen wrote to Lord Campbell, by this time
         Lord Chancellor, asking whether steps could not be taken to prevent the
         undesirable publicity attending divorce proceedings:
         These cases, which must necessarily
         increase when the new law becomes more and more known, fill now almost
         daily a large portion of the newspapers, and are of so scandalous a character that it
         makes it almost impossible for a paper to be trusted in the hand of a young lady
         or boy. None of the worst French novels from which careful parents try to protect
         their children can be as bad as what is daily brought and laid upon the
         breakfast-table of every educated family in England, and its effect must be
         most pernicious to the public morals of the country. The Lord Chancellor replied that, having
         attempted in the last session of Parliament to introduce a measure to give
         effect to the Queen's wish, and having been defeated, he was powerless to
         prevent the evil. The situation was otherwise in Scotland where divorce cases
         had always been tried in camera and only the judgment or verdict was
         published, while in Ireland it did not arise, although crim. con.  [i.e., "criminal conversation," civil actions by cuckolded
         husbands to be compensated for their losses due to the adultery of their wives] cases
         there continued to be reported in some detail. Hence the evidence in divorce
         cases in England were fully reported until after the First World War when the
         reports eventually restricted to conform with the practice in Scotland"
         (76-77).
