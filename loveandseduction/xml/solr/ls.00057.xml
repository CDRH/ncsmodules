         Preacher's Disgusting Licentiousness and Artful Plan of SeductionHIS VICTIM'S PITIFUL STORYUtica, N.Y., July 27.—Rev. Herbert
         C. Miller, an Episcopal
         clergyman, has been officiating in Gouverneur St. Lawrence county, for about
         two years. He is a widower, thirty-five years of age, a man of fine address,
         an elegant sermonizer, extremely studious, and a decided favorite with the
         ladies. The handsome rector was in demand in society, not only in Gouverneur,
         but in Watertown, Potsdam, Ogdenburgh, and other sections of central and
         northern New York. A rich congregation in Watertown gave him a flattering call
         at an advanced salary, and whenever he preached he was sure to attract people
         of culture.In his congregation at Gouverneur was a lady
         about twenty five years of age, a graduate of Vassar college, and one of the
         most accomplished ladies of that aristocratic little place. She is a blond of
         the fairest type, fascinating in conversation, and one of the leaders in
         society. About a year ago she was afflicted with a painful disease, and to
         allay physical pangs resorted to opium eating. Her complaint became
         aggravated, and threatened to render her a cripple for life. In August last
         the Rev. Mr. Miller became interested in her spiritual and physical welfare.
         She was a regular attendant at his church, and he pressed her to become
         confirmed. He questioned her as to the nature of her ailment, and when, after
         great persuasion, the young lady confided to him the delicate facts connected
         with her disease, he assured her that his dead wife had suffered in the same
         way, but her life had been sacrificed owing to the want of proper medical treatment.To clear the way and allay suspicion the
         rector
         pretended to write a celebrated doctor for advice as to the treatment of his
         confiding lady parishioner. The bogus letter from the physician arrived in due
         time, and the rector summoned the young lady to his study and read the letter.
         The document is utterly unfit for publication. It advises a vast amount of
         manipulation with the bare hand over certain portions of the naked person of
         the patient. It declares that the patient must submit to these manipulations
         frequently while in a reclining position, and "to accomplish the cure there
         must be no modesty in this matter." At first the girl, with natural delicacy
         objected to any such treatment, but the clergyman labored with her and asked
         her to pray for strength to overcome what he called her "false modesty."After several weeks of hesitation she at length
         consented to the manipulation, and for this purpose invited Mr. Miller to the
         residence of her parents. There, in the seclusion of her chamber, the poor
         girl submitted to the "treatment" which the clergyman declared would have saved
         his deceased wife had it been resorted to in time. In this way he accomplished
         the ruin of Miss Ella C. Moore. His visits were quite frequent for three or
         four months, and his guilty passion was indulged again and again. He conducted
         services regularly all the time, spent ten hours a day in his study and was
         regarded the ablest expounder of divine truth in northern New York.When the unfortunate girl discovered that she
         was about to become a mother she besought him to make her by marriage the only reparation in his power.  This he flatly refused
         to do, informing her that he was
         engaged to a beautiful girl in Gouverneur. This was literally true. At the
         period when he was engaged in his devilish machinations with Miss Moore he had
         also been making love to one of the most respectable ladies in town. He had
         succeeded in winning her affections; she wore the engagement ring, and the wedding
         day was set down for September next.Last week the condition of Miss Moore became
         apparent, and she revealed the truth to her horror-stricken father and mother.
         The case was laid before the vestrymen of St. John's Church, and upon being
         accused, Miller laid his hand on the bible, and, with tears in his eyes, called
         upon the Almighty to attest his innocence of the crime. Tuesday of this week
         he was arrested and taken before a police justice to answer to a charge of
         bastardy. This gave publicity to the matter, and people took sides pro and
         con. Miller was held in $5,000, and some of the wealthy men in his
         congregation becoming responsible for that amount he was released from custody.On Thursday the father of the betrayed girl
         sent
         a telegram to Wicasset, Maine, making inquiries regarding the character of
         Miller while preaching in that state. The reply received, yesterday, stated
         that Miller, when in Wicasset, was guilty of a most revolting and lecherous crime.  In the meantime other facts and circumstances
         came to light,
         and the rector hurriedly made arrangements to leave the country. He wrote to
         his betrothed, making professions of passionate love, and expressing the
         intention of ultimately returning to claim her as his wife. To his $5,000
         bondsman he wrote as follows:Gouverneur, July 26—To Dear Towley:Before going away I feel that I must at least leave note of
         thanks for yourself, Mr. Conklin, and Mr. Parsons, for your great kindness through this unhappy matter.  I have acknowledged
         the whole truth, but feel that it is impossible to marry
         this woman, knowing what I do of her. I have resigned my parish and ministry,
         and must begin life over again. I shall, at least, notwithstanding the past,
         strive to live purely and in the fear of God. I shall always be glad of our
         kindly associations together, and shall remember them with pleasure, though you
         may not. Very sincerely yours,"Herbert C. Miller."Milller then secreted himself on a freight train
         bound for Norristown on the St. Lawrence river and thence crossed to Brookville,   Canada. He did not leave a day too soon.
         The father of the misguided victim
         has placed the bogus medical letter in the hands of the authorities, and the
         revolting contents of the epistle becoming known, the United States officials
         would to-day have arrested him for circulating obscene literature.The case creates intense excitement, and the
         feeling is deepened by another scandal unearthed to-day. In brief, it is
         alleged that a deacon of the Methodist church, in Gouverneur, heretofore in
         good standing, has been charged with the seduction of a young woman about
         eighteen years of age. The names of the parties are withheld for the present.
          Gouverneur, July 26—To Dear Towley:Before going away I feel that I must at least leave note of thanks for yourself, Mr. Conklin,
         and Mr. Parsons, for your great kindness through this unhappy matter.  I have acknowledged the whole truth, but feel that
         it is impossible to marry
         this woman, knowing what I do of her. I have resigned my parish and ministry,
         and must begin life over again. I shall, at least, notwithstanding the past,
         strive to live purely and in the fear of God. I shall always be glad of our
         kindly associations together, and shall remember them with pleasure, though you
         may not. Very sincerely yours,"Herbert C. Miller."
