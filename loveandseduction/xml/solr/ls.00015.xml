      <field name="text">Louisa May Alcott, for example,
         whose work clearly registers Southworth's influence, depicts the literary
         career of Jo March in 
         Little Women (1869) as getting off to a bad start on account of Southworth. Eager to publish,
         Jo begins a career by writing stories in imitation of the extremely popular Mrs
         S. L. A. N. G. Northbury (an allusion so obvious that nobody at the time could
         have missed it). In chapter 27, 'Literary Lessons,' Jo first encounters what
         Alcott calls Mrs. Northbury's 'trash' at a typically high-brow Boston lecture
         on the Egyptian pyramids, where she is sitting next to a 'studious-looking'
         youth reading an illustrated paper called 
         The Weekly Volcano. 
         Glancing at the illustration, Jo
         wonders 'what unfortuitous concatenation of circumstances needed the melodramatic
         illustration of an Indian in full war costume, tumbling over a precipice with a
         wolf at his throat, while two infuriated young gentlemen, with unnaturally
         small feet and big eyes, were stabbing each other close by, and a disheveled
         female was flying away in the background, with her mouth wide open.' The story
         turns out to be one of 'that class of light literature in which the passions
         have a holiday, and when the author's invention fails, a grand catastrophe
         clears the stage of one-half the 
         dramatis personae, 
         leaving the other half to exult over their
         downfall.'Hearing from her studious-looking neighbour that the story
         is first-rate and that its author makes excellent money, Jo takes Mrs Northbury
         as her 'model' (ch. 34) and submits her own sensational efforts to 
         The Weekly Volcano. 
         'Eager to find material,' the
         inexperienced author reads up on incidents of 'folly, sin, and misery,' thereby
         unconsciously 'beginning to desecrate some of the womanliest attributes of a
         woman's character,' feeding 'heart and fancy on dangerous and unsubstantial
         food,' and 'fast brushing the innocent bloom from her nature by a premature
         acquaintance with the darker side of life, which comes soon enough to all of
         us.' Fortunately for Jo, at least in the narrator's view, she is rescued from
         the nefarious influence of Mrs Northbury by the exhortations of the middle-aged
         German intellectual who will become her husband, Professor Bhaer, who advises
         her 'to study simple, true, and lovely characters, wherever she found them.'Since Alcott herself had begun her
         career by publishing numerous potboiling melodramas under an assumed name
         (melodramas whose authorship remained unknown for many decades), she was
         obviously both alluding to and disavowing her own past through this critique.
         But unless one has read 
         The Hidden Hand, 
         one cannot realize that Jo March herself, arguably the nation's most
         famous tomboy heroine—Jo characterizes herself at the novel's outset by
         bitterly complaining over not being a boy—derives directly from Capitola,
         heroine of 
         The
         Hidden Hand. 
         This
         heroine, who enters
         the novel in boy's clothing and romps through it disrupting numerous
         expectations for womanly behaviour, is not only the first of a long line of
         tomboy heroines in American fiction, but one of only a few in the nineteenth
         century who never relinquishes nor apologizes for her tomboy character. She is
         also the progenitor of the many female action heroines, especially female
         detectives, who populate fiction today. These are the women characters whose
         energy, curiosity, sass, street savvy, and above all compellingsense of
         justice lead to adventures where they uncover secrets, right wrongs, and defend
         true morality over social custom. The basic message of these popular novels
         now, like the message of The Hidden Hand then, is that the essence of
         true womanhood lies within and can never be compromised by merely
         unconventional behaviour.
         The Hidden Hand
         takes place mostly in rural
         Virginia, after the urban street waif Capitola, who was mysteriously brought to
         New York City from Virginia as an infant by a domestic trying to save her life,
         returns there as ward of Ira Warfield, 'Old Hurricane.' Not content with life
         as the plantation belle Old Hurricane wants her to be, Capitola ranges around
         the countryside on horseback looking for adventures, a self-styled female
         version of Don Quixote. Even as she battles with the notorious bandit Black
         Donald and his gang, fights a mock duel, and rescues an imprisoned maiden, she
         is herself the target of much covert villainy, because although she does not
         know it she is heiress to a vast fortune misappropriated by the villainous Le
         Noirs, father and son, who live on the adjoining plantation. Like most of
         Southworth's novels, The Hidden Hand contains numerous initially
         unconnected plots and a large cast of apparently unrelated characters, all of
         which mesh in the denouement. Undoubtedly some of the fun in reading a
         Southworth serialization involved waiting to see how the author would weave all
         these seemingly loose strands into a single pattern.Unlike the far more genteel Jo
         March, whose womanly character is apparently besmirched merely by reading about
         crime and passion, Capitola has genuine 'premature acquaintance' with the
         darker side of life. We meet her as a street child trying to survive in New York City by masquerading as a boy. Also unlike
         Jo, Capitola's experiences and
         behaviour never even remotely begin to 'desecrate' her womanly character. Her
         reason for cross-dressing is, precisely, to preserve that character. 'While all
         the ragged boys I knew could get little jobs to earn bread, I, because I was a
         girl, was not allowed to carry a gentleman's parcel, or black his boots, or shovel
         the snow off a shopkeeper's pavement, or put in coal, or do anything that I
         could do just as well as they. And so, because I was a girl, there seemed to be
         nothing but starvation or beggary before me,' she explains. 'I felt bitter,'
         she goes on, 'against fate for not making me a boy!' Then, 'all of a sudden, a
         bright thought struck me: and I made up my mind to be a boy!' Disguised as a
         boy, Capitola can support herself by doing anything an 'honest lad' can do—the
         phrase making clear that no honest work was available to a 'lass'. 'The only
         thing that made me feel sorry, was to see what a fool I had been, not to turn
         to a boy before'.Since Capitola's masquerade would
         admittedly be difficult if not impossible to maintain as she matured, and since
         Southworth does not want to cut her story's ties to reality entirely, she
         rescues her heroine from life as a boy at the start of the novel. Except for
         her tendency to express herself in slang, and her continuing relation with her
         best friend, a young sailor named Herbert Greyson, Capitola loses touch with
         her street associations. But the issues of womanliness and gender introduced by
         this opening segment of the novel continue to frame the fiction. 'Come, come,
         my little man!—my good little woman, I mean,' says Hurricane to Capitola as she
         explains why she chose to put on boy's clothing; and late in the novel he is
         still calling her 'a New York newsboy,' complaining that she'll never be a
         woman, and addressing her alternately as sirrah and Miss.Certainly The Hidden Hand
         could not have been the wildly popular work it was if it had been merely
         serious and sober; at its core, this is an action comedy with a female lead.
         Yet readers in the United States before the Civil War expected a good moral as
         part of the package, and Southworth has several good morals to offer concerning
         women, men, and society. Throughout the novel Capitola continues to reject most
         rules of female decorum as humbug at best, perniciously hypocritical at worst.
         The author regularly attributes Capitola's attractiveness as a character, as
         well as her success within the plot where other female characters fail, to her
         recognition of the dangers of false ideologies of true womanhood. Although
         Southworth thereby attacks what seem to her destructively influential
         ideologies of the feminine, she also powerfully affirms her belief in an
         undeniable, real womanliness, and this is crucial to Capitola's appeal. From
         the start we realize that Capitola has put on boy's clothes to preserve her
         virginity; the point is made that conventional stereotypes, far from preserving
         female virtue, are inimical to it. Southworth's criticism of female stereotypes
         assumes that they injure women not only as human beings in general but as women
         in particular; hence, whatever women have to offer as women is lost not only to
         them but to society as well.
