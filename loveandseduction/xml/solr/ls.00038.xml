      <field name="text">Scene One: Emma and Rodolphe in a Balcony SeductionRodolphe, meanwhile, with Madame Bovary, had gone up to the first
         floor of the town hall, to the "council-room," and, as it was
         empty, he declared that they could enjoy the sight there more
         comfortably. He fetched three stools from the round table under
         the bust of the monarch, and having carried them to one of the
         windows, they sat down by each other.There was commotion on the platform, long whisperings, much
         
         parleying. At last the councillor got up. They knew now that his
         name was Lieuvain, and in the crowd the name was passed from one
         to the other. After he had collated a few pages, and bent over
         them to see better, he began:"Gentlemen! May I be permitted first of all (before addressing
         you on the object of our meeting to-day, and this sentiment will,
         I am sure, be shared by you all), may I be permitted, I say, to
         pay a tribute to the higher administration, to the government to
         the monarch, gentle men, our sovereign, to that beloved king, to
         whom no branch of public or private prosperity is a matter of
         indifference, and who directs with a hand at once so firm and
         wise the chariot of the state amid the incessant perils of a
         stormy sea, knowing, moreover, how to make peace respected as
         well as war, industry, commerce, agriculture, and the fine arts?""I ought," said Rodolphe, "to get back a little further.""Why?"
         said Emma.But at this moment the voice of the councillor rose to an
         extraordinary pitch. He declaimed:"This is no longer the time, gentlemen, when civil discord
         ensanguined our public places, when the landlord, the
         business-man, the working-man himself, falling asleep at night,
         lying down to peaceful sleep, trembled lest he should be awakened
         suddenly by the noise of incendiary tocsins, when the most
         subversive doctrines audaciously sapped foundations.""Well, someone down there might see me," Rodolphe resumed, "then
         I should have to invent excuses for a fortnight; and with my bad
         reputation—""Oh, you are slandering yourself," said Emma."No! It is dreadful, I assure you.""But, gentlemen," continued the
         councillor, "if, banishing from
         my memory the remembrance of these sad pictures, I carry my eyes
         back to the actual situation of our dear country, what do I see
         there?  Everywhere commerce and the arts are flourishing;
         everywhere new means of communication, like so many new arteries
         in the body of the state, establish within it new relations. Our
         great industrial centres have recovered all their activity;
         religion, more consolidated, smiles in all hearts; our ports are
         full, confidence is born again, and France breathes once more!""Besides," added Rodolphe, "perhaps from the world's point
         of
         view they are right.""How so?" she asked."What!" said he. "Do you not know that there are souls constantly
         tormented?  They need by turns to dream and to act, the purest
         passions and the most turbulent joys, and thus they fling
         themselves into all sorts of fantasies, of follies."Then she looked at him as one looks at a traveller who has
         voyaged over strange lands, and went on:"We have not even this distraction, we poor women!""A sad distraction, for happiness
         isn't found in it.""But is it ever found?" she asked."Yes; one day it comes," he answered."And this is what you have understood,"
         said the councillor."You, farmers, agricultural labourers! you pacific pioneers of a
         work that belongs wholly to civilization! you, men of progress
         and morality, you have understood, I say, that political storms
         are even more redoubtable than atmospheric disturbances!""It comes one day," repeated Rodolphe, "one day suddenly, and
         when one is despairing of it. Then the horizon expands; it is as
         if a voice cried, 'It is here!' You feel the need of confiding
         the whole of your life, of giving everything, sacrificing
         everything to this being. There is no need for explanations; they
         understand one another. They have seen each other in dreams!"
         (And he looked at her.) "In fine, here it is, this treasure so
         sought after, here before you. It glitters, it flashes; yet one
         still doubts, one does not believe it; one remains dazzled, as if
         one went out iron darkness into light."And as he ended Rodolphe suited the action to the word. He passed
         his hand over his face, like a man seized with giddiness. Then he
         let it fall on Emma's. She took hers away."And who would be surprised at it, gentlemen?  He only who is so
         blind, so plunged (I do not fear to say it), so plunged in the
         prejudices of another age as still to misunderstand the spirit of
         agricultural populations. Where, indeed, is to be found more
         patriotism than in the country, greater devotion to the public
         welfare, more intelligence, in a word?  And, gentlemen, I do not
         mean that superficial intelligence, vain ornament of idle minds,
         but rather that profound and balanced intelligence that applies
         itself above all else to useful objects, thus contributing to the
         good of all, to the common amelioration and to the support of the
         state, born of respect for law and the practice of duty—""Ah! again!" said Rodolphe. "Always 'duty.' I am sick of the
         word. They are a lot of old blockheads in flannel vests and of
         old women with foot-warmers and rosaries who constantly drone
         into our ears 'Duty, duty!' Ah! by Jove! one's duty is to feel
         what is great, cherish the beautiful, and not accept all the
         conventions of society with the ignominy that it imposes upon
         us.""Yet—yet—" objected Madame Bovary."No, no! Why cry out against the passions?  Are they not the one
         beautiful thing on the earth, the source of heroism, of
         enthusiasm, of poetry, music, the arts, of everything, in a
         word?""But one must," said Emma, "to some extent bow to the opinion of
         the world and accept its moral code.""Ah! but there are two," he replied. "The small, the
         conventional, that of men, that which constantly changes, that
         brays out so loudly, that makes such a commotion here below, of
         the earth earthly, like the mass of imbeciles you see down there.
         But the other, the eternal, that is about us and above, like the
         landscape that surrounds us, and the blue heavens that give us
         light."Monsieur Lieuvain had just wiped his mouth with a
         pocket-handkerchief. He continued:"And what should I do here gentlemen, pointing out to you the
         uses of agriculture?  Who supplies our wants?  Who provides our
         means of subsistence?  Is it not the agriculturist?  The
         agriculturist, gentlemen, who, sowing with laborious hand the
         fertile furrows of the country, brings forth the corn, which,
         being ground, is made into a powder by means of ingenious
         machinery, comes out thence under the name of flour, and from
         there, transported to our cities, is soon delivered at the
         baker's, who makes it into food for poor and rich alike. Again,
         is it not the agriculturist who fattens, for our clothes, his
         abundant flocks in the pastures?  For how should we clothe
         ourselves, how nourish ourselves, without the agriculturist?  And,
         gentlemen, is it even necessary to go so far for examples?  Who
         has not frequently reflected on all the momentous things that we
         get out of that modest animal, the ornament of poultry-yards,
         that provides us at once with a soft pillow for our bed, with
         succulent flesh for our tables, and eggs?  But I should never end
         if I were to enumerate one after the other all the different
         products which the earth, well cultivated, like a generous
         mother, lavishes upon her children. Here it is the vine,
         elsewhere the apple tree for cider, there colza, farther on
         cheeses and flax. Gentlemen, let us not forget flax, which has
         made such great strides of late years, and to which I will more
         particularly call your attention."He had no need to call it, for all the mouths of the multitude
         were wide open, as if to drink in his words. Tuvache by his side
         listened to him with staring eyes. Monsieur Derozerays from time
         to time softly closed his eyelids, and farther on the chemist,
         with his son Napoléon between his knees, put his hand behind his
         ear in order not to lose a syllable. The chins of the other
         members of the jury went slowly up and down in their waistcoats
         in sign of approval. The firemen at the foot of the platform
         rested on their bayonets; and Binet, motionless, stood with
         out-turned elbows, the point of his sabre in the air. Perhaps he
         could hear, but certainly he could see nothing, because of the
         visor of his helmet, that fell down on his nose. His lieutenant,
         the youngest son of Monsieur Tuvache, had a bigger one, for his
         was enormous, and shook on his head, and from it an end of his
         cotton scarf peeped out. He smiled beneath it with a perfectly
         infantine sweetness, and his pale little face, whence drops were
         running, wore an expression of enjoyment and sleepiness.The square as far as the houses was crowded with people. One saw
         folk leaning on their elbows at all the windows, others standing
         at doors, and Justin, in front of the chemist's shop, seemed
         quite transfixed by the sight of what he was looking at. In spite
         of the silence Monsieur Lieuvain's voice was lost in the air. It
         reached you in fragments of phrases, and interrupted here and
         there by the creaking of chairs in the crowd; then you suddenly
         heard the long bellowing of an ox, or else the bleating of the
         lambs, who answered one another at street corners. In fact, the
         cowherds and shepherds had driven their beasts thus far, and
         these lowed from time to time, while with their tongues they tore
         down some scrap of foliage that hung above their mouths.Rodolphe had drawn nearer to Emma, and said to her in a low
         voice, speaking rapidly:"Does not this conspiracy of the world revolt you?  Is there a
         single sentiment it does not condemn?  The noblest instincts, the
         purest sympathies are persecuted, slandered; and if at length two
         poor souls do meet, all is so organised that they cannot blend
         together. Yet they will make the attempt; they will flutter their
         wings; they will call upon each other. Oh! no matter. Sooner or
         later, in six months, ten years, they will come together, will
         love; for fate has decreed it, and they are born one for the
         other."His arms were folded across his knees, and thus lifting his face
         towards Emma, close by her, he looked fixedly at her. She noticed
         in his eyes small golden lines radiating from black pupils; she
         even smelt the perfume of the pomade that made his hair glossy.
         Then a faintness came over her; she recalled the Viscount who had
         waltzed with her at Vaubyessard, and his beard exhaled like this
         air an odour of vanilla and citron, and mechanically she
         half-closed her eyes the better to breathe it in. But in making
         this movement, as she leant back in her chair, she saw in the
         distance, right on the line of the horizon, the old diligence,
         the "Hirondelle," that was slowly descending the hill of Leux,
         dragging after it a long trail of dust. It was in this yellow
         carriage that Léon had so often come back to her, and by this
         route down there that he had gone for ever. She fancied she saw
         him opposite at his windows; then all grew confused; clouds
         gathered; it seemed to her that she was again turning in the
         waltz under the light of the lustres on the arm of the Viscount,
         and that Leon was not far away, that he was coming; and yet all
         the time she was conscious of the scent of Rodolphe's head by her
         side. This sweetness of sensation pierced through her old
         desires, and these, like grains of sand under a gust of wind,
         eddied to and fro in the subtle breath of the perfume which
         suffused her soul. She opened wide her nostrils several times to
         drink in the freshness of the ivy round the capitals. She took
         off her gloves, she wiped her hands, then fanned her face with
         her handkerchief, while athwart the throbbing of her temples she
         heard the murmur of the crowd and the voice of the councillor
         intoning his phrases. He said—"Continue, persevere; listen
         neither to the suggestions of routine, nor to the over-hasty
         councils of a rash empiricism."Apply yourselves, above all, to the amelioration of the soil, to
         good manures, to the development of the equine, bovine, ovine,
         and porcine races. Let these shows be to you pacific arenas,
         where the victor in leaving it will hold forth a hand to the
         vanquished, and will fraternise with him in the hope of better
         success. And you, aged servants, humble domestics, whose hard
         labour no Government up to this day has taken into consideration,
         come hither to receive the reward of your silent virtues, and be
         assured that the state henceforward has its eye upon you; that it
         encourages you, protects you; that it will accede to your just
         demands, and alleviate as much as in it lies the burden of your
         painful sacrifices."Monsieur Lieuvain then sat down; Monsieur Derozerays got up,
         beginning another speech. His was not perhaps so florid as that
         of the councillor, but it recommended itself by a more direct
         style, that is to say, by more special knowledge and more
         elevated considerations. Thus the praise of the Government took
         up less space in it; religion and agriculture more. He showed in
         it the relations of these two, and how they had always
         contributed to civilisation. Rodolphe with Madame Bovary was
         talking dreams, presentiments, magnetism. Going back to the
         cradle of society, the orator painted those fierce times when men
         lived on acorns in the heart of woods. Then they had left off the
         skins of beasts, had put on cloth, tilled the soil, planted the
         vine. Was this a good, and in this discovery was there not more
         of injury than of gain?  Monsieur Derozerays set himself this
         problem. From magnetism little by little Rodolphe had come to
         affinities, and while the president was citing Cincinnatus and
         his plough, Diocletian, planting his cabbages, and the Emperors
         of China inaugurating the year by the sowing of seed, the young
         man was explaining to the young woman that these irresistible
         attractions find their cause in some previous state of existence."Thus we," he said, "why did we come to know one another?
         What
         chance willed it?  It was because across the infinite, like two
         streams that flow but to unite; our special bents of mind had
         driven us towards each other."And he seized her hand; she did not withdraw it."For good farming generally!" cried the president."Just
         now, for example, when I went to your house.""To Monsieur Bizat of Quincampoix.""Did I know I should accompany you?""Seventy
         francs.""A hundred times I wished to go; and I followed you—I remained.""Manures!""And I shall remain to-night, to-morrow,
         all other days, all my
         life!""To Monsieur Caron of Argueil, a gold medal!""For I have never in the society of any other person found so
         complete a charm.""To Monsieur Bain of Givry-Saint-Martin.""And I shall carry away with me the remembrance of you.""For a
         merino ram!""But you will forget me; I shall pass away like a shadow.""To Monsieur Belot of Notre-Dame.""Oh, no! I shall be
         something in your thought, in your life,
         shall I not?""Porcine race; prizes—equal, to Messrs. Lehérissé and
         Cullembourg, sixty francs!"Rodolphe was pressing her hand, and he felt it all warm and
         quivering like a captive dove that wants to fly away; but,
         whether she was trying to take it away or whether she was
         answering his pressure; she made a movement with her fingers. He
         exclaimed:"Oh, I thank you! You do not repulse me! You are good! You
         understand that I am yours! Let me look at you; let me
         contemplate you!"A gust of wind that blew in at the window ruffled the cloth on
         the table, and in the square below all the great caps of the
         peasant women were uplifted by it like the wings of white
         butterflies fluttering."Use of oil-cakes," continued the president. He was hurrying on:"Flemish manure—flax-growing—drainage—long
         leases—domestic
         service."Rodolphe was no longer speaking. They looked at one another. A
         supreme desire made their dry lips tremble, and wearily, without
         an effort, their fingers intertwined."Catherine Nicaise Elizabeth Leroux, of Sassetot-la-Guerrière,
         for fifty-four years of service at the same farm, a silver
         medal—value, twenty-five francs!""Where is Catherine Leroux?" repeated the councillor.She did not present herself, and one
         could hear voices
         whispering:"Go up!""Don't be afraid!""Oh, how stupid she is!""Well, is she there?" cried Tuvache."Yes; here she is.""Then
         let her come up!"Then there came forward on the platform a little old woman with
         timid bearing, who seemed to shrink within her poor clothes. On
         her feet she wore heavy wooden clogs, and from her hips hung a
         large blue apron. Her pale face framed in a borderless cap was
         more wrinkled than a withered russet apple. And from the sleeves
         of her red jacket looked out two large hands with knotty joints,
         the dust of barns, the potash of washing the grease of wools had
         so encrusted, roughened, hardened these that they seemed dirty,
         although they had been rinsed in clear water; and by dint of long
         service they remained half open, as if to bear humble witness for
         themselves of so much suffering endured. Something of monastic
         rigidity dignified her face. Nothing of sadness or of emotion
         weakened that pale look. In her constant living with animals she
         had caught their dumbness and their calm. It was the first time
         that she found herself in the midst of so large a company, and
         inwardly scared by the flags, the drums, the gentlemen in
         frock-coats, and the order of the councillor, she stood
         motionless, not knowing whether to advance or run away, nor why
         the crowd was pushing her and the jury were smiling at her.
         Thus stood before these radiant bourgeois this half-century of
         servitude."Approach, venerable Catherine Nicaise Elizabeth Leroux!" said
         the councillor, who had taken the list of prize-winners from the
         president; and, looking at the piece of paper and the old woman
         by turns, he repeated in a fatherly tone—"Approach! approach!""Are you deaf?" said Tuvache, fidgeting in his armchair; and
         he
         began shouting in her ear, "Fifty-four years of service. A silver
         medal! Twenty-five francs! For you!"Then, when she had her medal, she looked at it, and a smile of
         beatitude spread over her face; and as she walked away they could
         hear her muttering "I'll give it to our cure up home, to say some
         masses for me!""What fanaticism!" exclaimed the chemist, leaning across to the
         notary.The meeting was over, the crowd dispersed, and now that the
         speeches had been read, each one fell back into his place again,
         and everything into the old grooves; the masters bullied the
         servants, and these struck the animals, indolent victors, going
         back to the stalls, a green-crown on their horns.The National Guards, however, had gone up to the first floor of
         the town hall with buns spitted on their bayonets, and the
         drummer of the battalion carried a basket with bottles. Madame
         Bovary took Rodolphe's arm; he saw her home; they separated at
         her door; then he walked about alone in the meadow while he
         waited for the time of the banquet.
