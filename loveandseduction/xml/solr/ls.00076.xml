      <field name="text">An Elopement
         in a CarriageA scoundrel named John Right has recently
         seduced a young girl at Wyethville, Va. and eloped with her to the west or
         south. The poor and infatuated young girl, whom this destroyer has thus made
         the dupe of his bribes and artifices and faithless promises, is Margaret E.
         Oury, the daughter of Thomas Oury, of Wyethville, and about 15 or 16 years of
         age. We have understood they are making their way towards Lynchburg or Richmond, and will probably change their course and
         pass through Franklin county and the
         state of North Carolina to the south. They represent they were married in
         Wyethville, a statement which is utterly false. They are traveling in a two
         horse barouche, with a cover on it, driven by a likely mulatto man. He came
         from Knoxville, Tennessee, where he has a young wife now living, and suffering
         the unspeakable pangs of his remorseless and inhuman conduct, and spent the
         summer at the Grayson Sulphur Springs.
