      <field name="text">Scene Four: 
         Emma and Leon's standing rendezvous in a hotelFor fear of
         being seen, she did not usually take the most direct road. She plunged into
         dark alleys, and, all perspiring, reached the bottom of the Rue Nationale, near
         the fountain that stands there. It, is the quarter for theatres, public-houses,
         and whores. Often a cart would pass near her, bearing some shaking scenery.
         Waiters in aprons were sprinkling sand on the flagstones between green shrubs.
         It all smelt of absinthe, cigars, and oysters. She turned down
         a street; she recognised him by his curling hair that escaped from beneath his
         hat. Léon walked along the
         pavement. She followed him to the hotel. He went up, opened the door,
         entered—What an embrace! Then, after the
         kisses, the words gushed forth. They told each other the sorrows of the week,
         the presentiments, the anxiety for the letters; but now everything was
         forgotten; they gazed into each other's faces with voluptuous laughs, and
         tender names. The bed was
         large, of mahogany, in the shape of a boat. The curtains were in red levantine,
         that hung from the ceiling and bulged out too much towards the bell-shaped
         bedside; and nothing in the world was so lovely as her brown head and white
         skin standing out against this purple colour, when, with a movement of shame,
         she crossed her bare arms, hiding her face in her hands. The warm room,
         with its discreet carpet, its gay ornaments, and its calm light, seemed made
         for the intimacies of passion. The curtain-rods, ending in arrows, their brass
         pegs, and the great balls of the fire-dogs shone suddenly when the sun came in.
         On the chimney between the candelabra there were two of those pink shells in
         which one hears the murmur of the sea if one holds them to the ear. How they loved
         that dear room, so full of gaiety, despite its rather faded splendour! They
         always found the furniture in the same place, and sometimes hairpins, that she
         had forgotten the Thursday before, under the pedestal of the clock. They
         lunched by the fireside on a little round table, inlaid with rosewood. Emma
         carved, put bits on his plate with all sorts of coquettish ways, and she
         laughed with a sonorous and libertine laugh when the froth of the champagne ran
         over from the glass to the rings on her fingers. They were so completely lost
         in the possession of each other that they thought themselves in their own
         house, and that they would live there till death, like two spouses eternally
         young. They said "our room," "our carpet," she even said
         "my slippers," a gift of Léon's, a whim she had had. They were pink
         satin, bordered with swansdown. When she sat on his knees, her leg, then too
         short, hung in the air, and the dainty shoe, that had no back to it, was held
         only by the toes to her bare foot. He for the
         first time enjoyed the inexpressible delicacy of feminine refinements. He had
         never met this grace of language, this reserve of clothing, these poses of the
         weary dove. He admired the exaltation of her soul and the lace on her
         petticoat. Besides, was she not "a lady" and a married woman—a real
         mistress, in fine?By the
         diversity of her humour, in turn mystical or mirthful, talkative, taciturn,
         passionate, careless, she awakened in him a thousand desires, called up instincts
         or memories. She was the mistress of all the novels, the heroine of all the
         dramas, the vague "she" of all the volumes of verse. He found again
         on her shoulder the amber colouring of the "Odalisque Bathing"; she
         had the long waist of feudal chatelaines, and she resembled the "Pale
         Woman of Barcelona." But above all she was the Angel! Often looking
         at her, it seemed to him that his soul, escaping towards her, spread like a
         wave about the outline of her head, and descended drawn down into the whiteness
         of her breast. He knelt on the ground before her, and with both elbows on her
         knees looked at her with a smile, his face upturned. She bent over
         him, and murmured, as if choking with intoxication: "Oh, do
         not move! do not speak! look at me! Something so sweet comes from your eyes
         that helps me so much!" She called him
         "child." "Child, do you love me?" And she did not
         listen for his answer in the haste of her lips that fastened to his mouth. On the clock
         there was a bronze cupid, who smirked as he bent his arm beneath a golden
         garland. They had laughed at it many a time, but when they had to part
         everything seemed serious to them. Motionless in
         front of each other, they kept repeating, "Till Thursday, till
         Thursday." Suddenly she
         seized his head between her hands, kissed him hurriedly on the forehead,
         crying, "Adieu!" and rushed down the stairs.
