      <field name="text">Female Friends and Would-Be WifeTo
         understand the breach of promise suit filed in the St. Louis Court of Common
         Pleas against Henry Shaw as he was preparing to open his garden, a look at his
         social attitudes and interests is imperative. In his sketch of Shaw's life,
         Thomas Dimmock attributed to historian Frederick L. Billon, a friend of Henry,
         the remark that Shaw "seemed to avoid making acquaintances among the
         girls. . . . He intended marrying some English girl."' Nowhere in his
         extant writings, however, did Shaw give such an indication. He never discussed
         his cousin Henry Hoole's suggestions that he marry "Cousin Mary," and
         he ignored his sister Sarah's recommendation of several lovely Guernsey girls.On
         one occasion, as already stated, Caroline suggested that she, Sarah, and Henry
         would probably remain "spinsters." And Shaw doubted that his cousin
         Francis Hoole's impending marriage with Alathea Tattershal would bring him any
         great happiness. Shaw's remark seemed to transcend Francis's choice of marriage
         partner and to take a derogatory view of married life in general. While Henry
         traveled through Europe, on the other hand, he received letters from Demosthenes
         ("Demo") Simos that spoke of young ladies they had met; and Shaw's
         cousin Henry Hoole joked about the Missourian's amorous adventures on the
         Continent. Shaw himself' wrote in his journal of the many young ladies he saw
         on his travels and spoke most warmly of a lovely Caroline he met on his first
         visit to Vienna.Among his miscellaneous letters, Shaw kept several from
         friendly French girls, such as Aimée Dupont, to whom he sent gifts after his
         return to St. Louis and some from a St. Louis woman by the name of Honorine
         Douard, written in 1849. The latter explained in one of her letters that she
         wrote in English because others were present in the room. French was presumably
         her native language. She misspelled several words and seemed at times ill at
         ease with English. She called herself "your little Honorine" and
         suggested that their relationship was close. She apologized for the deception
         in not telling him that she was married. "If you wish to aid me, as you
         promised, [you] will enclose the rest of the money you promised me. . . . My
         husband is in a situation that he can give me no money now. "
         A short time later, signing herself Honorine Beranger, presumably her
         married name, she thanked him for the money and for his wishes for her
         happiness. "My dear friend," she went on, "you say you will see
         me at Mrs. Harmony's, but if possible I would prefer that you will see me
         tomorrow at my sister's at two o'clock."  
         These female relationships were temporary and more or less
         private. A later one gained national notoriety for
         Shaw. As Shaw walked in his garden one morning, he saw a young woman whom he
         later described to a friend as "not only a pretty woman but a fascinating
         one." After he got acquainted, she came regularly to the garden.
         When she did not come, she would send him a note (none of which he kept). In early
         February 1856 this young woman, whose name was Effie Carstang borrowed $100
         from Shaw to be returned on demand. Slightly over a year later, she borrowed
         another $100. In August 1857, Effie rented from Shaw for one dollar a month a
         rosewood piano made in Baltimore.  She agreed to send it back on recall. Shaw
         later took the piano back, but that was not the last word on the musical
         instrument from Miss Carstang.On 19 July 1858, Effie Carstang sued Henry Shaw in
         the St. Louis Court of Common Pleas for breach of promise of marriage. She alleged
         that a friendship had grown between them and that in November 1856 she had
         promised to marry him and Shaw in turn had promised to marry her. She remained
         willing to marry the defendant. In the original claim, she asked damages to the
         amount of $20,000 but then scratched over that figure and wrote $100,000 in the
         line above with the approval of the court. 
         
         In a response three months later, Henry Shaw denied that
         on any day in November 1856 or on any other day before or since had he ever
         promised to marry Miss Carstang or asked her to marry him. He denied that she
         had sustained any damages of any amount whatsoever. Shaw, in fact, had a
         counterclaim. He held two promissory notes—one of 28 February 1856 and one of 19 May 1857. In each instance Effie had borrowed
         $100
         from him and agreed to pay on demand. Shaw insisted she had not paid.
         Strangely, Henry never alluded to the rental of the rosewood piano, even though
         Effie and her sister both mentioned the "gift" of a piano that Shaw
         took back sometime later.
         The 
         Missouri
         Democrat 
         described Effie as a young woman of about thirty, tall and
         graceful, with dark hair, brilliant eyes, blonde complexion, and "a mouth
         expressive of great firmness and decision of character." The same edition
         described Henry Shaw as "about sixty years of age, with hair somewhat
         grey, rather sharp features, but with an expression of countenance anything but
         disagreeable. He was a man of great wealth, and his Tower Grove home was one of
         the finest residences in the neighborhood of St. Louis." The article
         concluded, "Mr. Shaw is one of our oldest citizens and during a long
         residence here he has sustained a character hitherto unimpeachable."Years
         later, 
         Reedy's Mirror, 
         the one St. Louis-based
         periodical to win a reputation beyond the borders of the United States for pungent literary criticism and the discovery of
         new authors, described Henry and
         Effie in an unexcelled way:
         
         Henry
         Shaw was a hardware man ... a nailing good one. By close application to
         business, attention to judiciously advertising his wares, an incessant working
         of the scissors in clipping coupons, he amassed a competency which later he
         invested in St. Louis dirt. Then his eye, 'in a fine frenzy rolling,' turned from
         the dreary monotony of spikes and mauls to the heavenly ecstasy of flowers ...
         and engaged in what Bacon declared the most pleasing occupation of
         man-gardening.... an Englishman, stolid, dogmatic, lettered - a man of strong
         conviction, few intimate friendships but genial with those who succeeded in
         getting into his charmed circle.... Somewhere and under some strange
         concatenation of circumstances, Henry Shaw met Effie Carstang. Tall and willowy
         was Effie. Her entire get-up, her tout
         ensemble, . . . was gorgeous.
         She possessed a pair of orbs that made diamonds look like cobblestones, cheeks
         that caused roses to look up ... a form that set artists to climbing poles, a
         voice that threw musicians into conniptions, lips—now by the beard of the
         Prophet—she had lips.    Such
         were the principals in a stirring court drama. Lawyers for the plaintiff were
         Maj. Uriel L. Wright, state legislator and spellbinding criminal lawyer, and L.
         M. Shreve. Judge Edward Bates, John R. Shepley, and Judge James R. Lackland
         defended Shaw. While the other four were well known locally, Bates, nephew of
         an early Missouri gover-nor and a national figure, had represented Missouri in
         the U.S. Congress, served in the state senate, and, after declining a position
         in the administration of President Millard Fillmore, became judge of the St.
         Louis Land Court. He had presided at the Whig National Convention m Baltimore in 1856; as one of the Republican candidates
         in 1860, he would amass almost half
         as many votes as Abraham Lincoln on the first ballot at the convention in Chicago. The following year Lincoln would name him
         attorney general of the United States.On
         the opening day of the trial, Friday, 27 May 1859, before Judge Sam
         Reber, the sister of Miss Carstang, Mrs. Marie Seaman, testified in Effie's
         behalf. She spoke of Shaw's visits and gifts, including the piano and books on
         botany, and the interpretation she and her sister placed on these favors. On
         Saturday, 28 May, the second day, the courtroom was crowded during the long
         testimony, most of it evidence for the plaintiff. The counsel for the defense
         extensively cross-examined Mrs. Seaman.The
         Missouri
         Republican 
         generally gave much less
         attention to the trial than the 
         Democrat 
         did,
         but on 30 May the 
         Republican 
         quoted at length the long
         speech of Shaw's attorney Shepley. Surprisingly, Shepley admitted the costly
         gifts that his client had given Effie: valuable jewelry as a token of his
         affection and the best fruits of his garden in Tower Grove. On Wednesday a man
         by the name of Canese from Charleston, South Carolina, testified that Effie had
         resided at an establishment frequented by "dashing fellows." But
         Effie's counsel brought contrary evidence. Especially strong was that of judge
         Alexander Hamilton, who said that the sisters were good tenants and prompt in
         paying rent. From his business associations with them, he knew nothing
         disagreeable about them. Everything, in fact, indicated the contrary. Another
         witness, John Brady, also praised Miss Carstang.On
         Thursday, 2 June, the sixth day of the case, the huge crowd again assembled.
         The judge instructed the jury that it was not necessary to have clear evidence
         of mutual consent of the respective parties; the jurors could infer a promise
         of marriage from the circumstances of the relationship; no mutual expressions
         of intention were needed, nor was any third-party witness. The judge also
         directed them to make any monetary decision not simply on financial values, but
         to consider any psychological or other difficulties the young woman had
         endured.After
         the judge had instructed the jury, Major Wright introduced testimony for the
         plaintiff from a man in South Carolina to counter the remarks of Mr. Canese of
         the day before. This gentleman testified that Effie's character was not
         tarnished as alleged. Major Wright proposed to introduce a further witness, but
         Bates and Shepley objected that no new witnesses should be introduced. The
         judge sustained the objection.At
         some time during the trial a letter became public that Effie had allegedly sent
         to Henry. (Three weeks after the trial, William McHenry, commercial editor of
         the Missouri
         Republican, 
         stated that during the
         trial, a counsel for Miss Carstang had pointed to such a letter, wanting the
         jury to read it, but the court had excluded it.) In this letter
         Effie stated that Shaw had visited her in her home. He had sent her flowers,
         fruit, and other presents and seemed to desire that their relationship should
         be made public. He sent a piano as a gift. She claimed he named a marriage time
         and then postponed it because of arrangements at the Garden. Then he took the
         piano back to his own house under the plea of a party to be held there. Finally
         he ceased to visit her. Presuming he might be sick, she called on him at his
         house, only to have him insult her with an indecent proposition. Effie
         concluded her letter, "Had you called me as a gentleman and offered a
         reasonable excuse or simply asked me to release you from this engagement and
         assigned a reason, I trust I should have had too much pride not
         to have complied at once. But your desertion, as it is, deserves whatever punishment
         the opinion of a just public may visit upon its author."On
         the seventh day of the trial, Friday, 3 June, the crowd was larger than ever.
         Judge Bates "bombarded his hearers," to use the Missouri
         Democrat's
         
         words, from 10:15 to 12:15.
         Following this, Major Wright summarized the case in a speech that lasted
         two and three-quarters hours. The 
         Democrat 
         described
         it as the most eloquent speech ever made by the distinguished advocate. The crowded
         courtroom burst continuously into noisy applause. Judge Reber admonished the
         spectators for this excessive demonstration and ordered the sheriff to arrest
         disturbers; only then did they grow quiet.At
         four o'clock the jury gave its unanimous verdict—for Effie Carstang. The
         crowd vented its full joy in the rotunda.  The MissouriDemocrat believed that the decision was a popular one. The Missouri
         
         
         Republican 
         
         had little comment on the day of the verdict, but early the next year was
         to speak favorably of the decision and of the plaintiff. Judge Sam Reber
         awarded Effie damages of 
         $100,000.
         In his diary for
         4 June, a day later, Attorney Bates wrote, "This atrocious verdict has
         excited, as it ought, the indignant denunciation of the public. We have moved
         for a new trial. . . . Jurors were so stupid or wicked, or both."   The
         evidence, Bates felt, all pointed to a verdict for the defendant. "Yet we
         were all astonished that a verdict was rendered, after but a few minutes
         deliberation, for the plaintiff, with an assessment of damages of
         $100,000." Bates presumed that judge Reber would want to cleanse his
         record of so vile a blot upon the administration of justice. "The
         abominable verdict shocked the moral sense of the community and made most men
         fear for the safety of property and character."Perhaps
         Bates judged the situation properly, perhaps not. To the wealthy people it was
         a bad verdict; to the average poor person of the city, and of course there were
         many more of them, the verdict seemed a good one, at least if one may judge
         from the words of the MissouriDemocrat. On the same day that Bates
         wrote those words in his diary, Shepley joined him in asking for a new trial,
         citing many reasons. They claimed that the verdict was against the law,
         evidence, truth, and decency. They claimed, on the one hand, that the
         instructions of the court were not followed; and on the other, that the court
         admitted improper testimony and excluded proper testimony. They alleged that
         the jurors were prejudiced against the defendant and reached their decision by
         bargain and compromise, not by judgment. The Records of the Court of Common
         Pleas asserted:
         
         The
         plaintiff in the progress of the trial was guilty of a gross—impropriety and contempt of court in causing to be published
         in a newspaper, a
         letter purporting to be from the plaintiff to the defendant, which had been
         offered in evidence by the 
         plaintiff 
         and
         ruled out by the court; and the publication of which was well calculated if not
         designed to bring bias and mislead the jury. The amount of the damages assessed
         by the jury is excessive—unjustly and preposterously large—unsupported by
         testimony and, of itself, proof of prejudice, passion and misconduct on the
         part of the jurors.On
         8 June, Moritz Stienbach, one of the jurors, stated that he did not understand
         English well, did not believe the verdict righteous, did not understand
         American practice, and thought he had to go along with the majority. Six days
         later another original juror, G. W. Chadwick, countered by notifying Wright
         that Shepley had clearly questioned Stienbach as to his understanding and
         command of English and was satisfied. And, Chadwick continued, when the jury
         had retired to the jury room, "All agreed at once to a verdict—except Mr.
         Stienbach, and he did not object because of any proofs in the case," but
         because a German newspaper the day before had questioned Effie's conduct in Charleston. After explanation, Stienbach agreed
         that he was for a verdict of $100,000.
         Chadwick notarized the letter the same day and submitted it to the attorneys,
         but the plea for a new trial prevailed.As
         soon as the court agreed to a retrial, the attorneys for the beleaguered
         bachelor set to work. On 6 June, two days after Shaw's lawyers had submitted
         their appeal, a certain A. H. Smith of Sing Sing, New York, offered to bring
         proof of Effie's bad character. Fourteen days later he wrote that his wife knew
         of the sour reputation of both Effie and her sister, Marie Seaman, and offered
         names of parties for evidence. Many other letters came in June or July of that
         year that dealt in a negative way with the character, background, or
         antecedents of Effie Carstang. A New Yorker by the name of J. Nichols stated
         that some time before her father's death Effie had sued a certain Young Brown
         for breach of promise. Another resident of New York, Peter Heiler, wrote that
         Effie had brought suit against an otherwise unidentified Captain Williams.
         Three letters came from Brooklyn: John Samow claimed that he had facts to set
         aside the first judgment; John Holdreth accused Effie of improper conduct in
         church — she had smiled during the sermon (horror of horrors!); and Thomas J.
         Berry, a Brooklyn sailmaker, listed five men who "spoke lightly" of
         Effie. An attorney in Cincinnati, R. D. Henry, also claimed that he had facts
         to set aside the first judgment.The
         magnitude of the initial verdict made the case a national concern. The 
         New
         York Illustrated News 
         called it "the largest sum ever
         awarded in this country in such an action." When the appeal came to court
         in March 1860, 
         Harper's Weekly 
         reminded its readers that
         this was the great breach of promise case of the previous year that gave a
         verdict of $100,000 damages for the plaintiff. The article added a few personal
         items about Effie and Shaw. She was attractive; her father, a widower,
         Methodist, and businessman, had died ten years before. Effie had met Shaw in
         1856, and the alleged promise of marriage had come in November of the following
         year. Henry Shaw had lived in St. Louis forty-one years; he was a merchant with
         great wealth, was of medium height, had a hardy complexion with blue eyes, and
         possessed a great suavity of manners; in fact, he was one of the politest men
         in St. Louis. His wealth was estimated at between one-and-a-half and two
         million dollars. He had turned a barren prairie into an Eden.Marie
         Seaman testified again that Shaw had begun to visit her sister, who lived with
         her, two or three times a week in 1856. He gave her jewelry, a piano, gloves,
         fruit, flowers, and other gifts. Generally he brought a gift at each visit. He
         brought books about botany, since he wanted Effie to know botany before they
         married. Shaw told Marie that he intended to marry Effie, and she began to
         prepare for the wedding in 1857. When she and Effie visited Shaw, she never saw
         any white person at his residence. Cross-examination avoided Mrs. Seaman's
         allegations and concentrated on her divorce to cast suspicion on her
         personally. At
         least three different men, Joseph Havener, Moses Abbott, and Thomas Yostic,
         said that John Carter, one of the jurors, had publicly stated in their presence
         that Effie was not a decent woman and that Shaw was unjustly condemned in the
         first trial. Carter denied having made such a statement.As counsel for
         the defendant, Shepley summarized his position in this way: Effie sought Shaw's
         acquaintance for the purpose of entrapping him. Hence most of the twenty days
         of the trial consisted of depositions and testimony from men who claimed that
         Effie had engaged in prostitution in Brooklyn, Cincinnati, and Charleston. Most of them said that they had 
         heard 
         she
         was "a wanton woman." At least one of the men, Steven Birch, was so
         confused under cross-examination that he testified that Effie was both a good
         and a bad woman at the same time. The most damaging statement against Effie's
         character came from James I. Cochran of Cincinnati on the eighteenth day.
         Cochran had bad things to say about Effie; personally, he had kissed her, but
         would not admit to having had intercourse with her.Effie
         Carstang's counsel had been allowed to take a deposition from John Forbush, a
         crippled man in Cincinnati who knew Cochran. Forbush stated that Cochran was a
         perennial liar and known to be such. As to the allegation that Effie was a
         woman of easy virtue, he had never heard anyone make such a statement. He
         stated under questioning, "Neither Miss Carstang nor anyone else offered
         to pay me anything for testifying in this case."Judge
         Reber excluded testimony that called into question the veracity of several
         witnesses for Shaw, and he did not allow the letter from Effie to Shaw to be
         used. The 
         Missouri Democrat 
         felt that the letter's
         publication in the 
         Republican 
         had really formed the basis
         for successful application for a new trial.The
         verdict against Effie came on Saturday, 31 March 1860, the twentieth day of the
         trial. The 
         Missouri Democrat 
         stated flatly that the
         decision "on the whole surprised the community . . . . Even people in Cincinnati thought she would win and people questioned
         the impartiality of the jury as others
         did in earlier decisions. For instance, allegedly the foreman of the jury was
         seen going to Shaw's house before the verdict. The majority of people seemed to
         think that Effie should have gotten something, at least court costs." The  Missouri
         Republican 
         gave less space to the verdict in the case than to judge
         Bates's candidacy for the presidency. It did comment on the throng in the
         courtroom, and it praised Major Wright for his summary as a "burst of
         oratory sparkling in wit and humor and sharp edged sarcasms . . . [and]
         historical allusions."Effie
         submitted her request for a new trial on 2 June 1860,
         basing her petition on the fact that several jurors were prejudiced, among them
         John Carter and Charles Schuler, who allegedly stated that he had made 
         up his mind and would not change his view no matter
         what Major Wright or anyone else said.
         While
         the feature writer for the 
         New York Illustrated News 
         expected
         a new trial, he took an ambivalent view on the one just completed. He thought
         the whole Union should show its appreciation to the jury for its common sense
         "in the face of lovely women ... immense legal talent, every possible
         technicality . . . [and] every known precedent, unlike most juries in his
         neighborhood that have hitherto been notorious for their liberal donations to
         female plaintiffs of other people's money. " In the
         same issue, ten pages later, the writer spoke of Shaw's "scandalous means
         of defense. He ransacked the country to destroy forever the character of a more
         youthful, humble and poor antagonist." But the writer agreed that Shaw
         had no alternative under the initial verdict. Shaw was "prompted by a hope
         of neutralizing the strong feeling the people of St. Louis seemed to entertain
         toward the plaintiff " The writer saw no real disgrace in proposing
         marriage and then backing off. He felt that "Shaw was smarting under the
         heavy verdict in the first trial."
         The
         
         St. Louis Times 
         expressed joy that the case
         was over and noted the general regret that the plaintiff did not get something.
         It saw Shaw in a "most unenviable position" and concluded that both
         lost. Effie appeared as "an 
         intriguante 
         and
         adventurer of the most dangerous type" and Shaw "as a libertine of
         seventy [sic]." The incidents revealed "more meanness than passion."Shaw's
         counselor, Edward Bates, had left a vehement denunciation of the first verdict
         in his diary. That journal—at least in the printed edition - did not even
         mention the second trial. On the day of the verdict, in fact, Bates wrote
         highly critical analyses of President James Buchanan's forays into the field of
         lawmaking.Judge
         Bates, who in reality did little at either hearing, received $250 in fees for
         each of the two trials; Shepley's fees for both suits amounted to $1,425.
         Disbursement by Judge J. R. Lackland reached $2,079 for travel and expenditures
         in rounding up testimony. Shaw's entire expenditure on the case totaled
         $15,358.81 at first counting.The
         difference between the fees of Shepley and Bates and the disbursements of
         Lackland on the one hand and the total expenses on the other leave unaccounted
         about $10,000. Why this strange discrepancy?  
         Reedy's Mirror, 
         many
         years later, said it went to Charles E Cady. The article stated:
         
         . . . Charlie Cady . . . one of the legal staff . . .
         packed his grip and made a bee-line for the city down on the Atlantic seaboard.
         Better than his education as a lawyer was his experience as a
         "rounder" on such a mission. He turned Charleston upside down, in and
         out, secured enough depositions to load a freight car, and sufficient testimony
         of a damaging character to blacken and blast and smash and utterly annihilate
         the reputation of all the saints in the calendar. Then he returned to St.
         Louis, walked into court with a countenance as innocent of guile as a babe's,
         and began to open up and read document after document of such salaciousness of,
         and concerning the said Effie Carstang, she and her heirs and assigns forever,
         as to cause bald heads of that day and generation to clutch at their whiskers,
         to marvel that doings of the kind described could be carried on in a free and
         enlightened republic. Effie Carstang didn't get her hands on a cent on account
         of her suit against Shaw, but Charlie Cady did. He pocketed Ten Thousand in
         very cool, exceeding cool cash.Cady
         did not get the full $10,000, though. He accounted for almost half that much
         money: $2,526.37 in rounding up testimony, $1,525 in salary for his efforts.
         The destination of the other six thousand remains one of the few unaccounted
         outlays in Shaw's account book.This
         proved the most sensational, but not the last court case involving Henry Shaw.
         His business papers show 122 court cases, usually involving minor questions of
         property. They would begin in 1870 and reach a high of fifteen in 1880, with
         the second highest number, eight, in 1888, the last full year of Shaw's life.Effie
         Carstang and her sister Marie Seaman presumably moved away from St. Louis shortly after the trial. During several previous
         years the 
         St.
         Louis Directory 
         had listed Mrs. M. Seaman as residing at 123 N. 5th St. Effie resided with her sister in property rented from judge Alexander
         Hamilton. After the trial the name of Mrs. M. Seaman no longer appeared in the 
         St. Louis Directory. 
         Though
         he never married, Shaw did have a true and lasting love, according to the
         testimony of a man who held the post of head gardener for the last twenty years
         of Shaw's life. In an interview years later, the gardener told a woman reporter
         for the 
         Republic, 
         "She was an American
         girl and neither he nor she ever married." One day when they were past
         seventy, she called on Shaw, and the gardener saw them walking arm in arm
         through the Garden in the moonlight. The gardener thought they would at last
         marry. When asked why they had never done so, he responded,
         "That I know, but I shall never tell you or anyone." The gardener, no
         doubt, kept his word.
