      <field name="text">Scene One:  Eugénie visits her sick cousin in his chamber at nightThus passed the solemn day which was destined to weight
         upon the whole
         life of the rich and poor heiress, whose sleep was never again to be
         so calm, nor yet so pure, as it had been up to this moment. It often
         happens that certain actions of human life seem, literally speaking,
         improbable, though actual. Is not this because we constantly omit to
         turn the stream of psychological light upon our impulsive
         determinations, and fail to explain the subtile reasons, mysteriously
         conceived in our minds, which impelled them? Perhaps Eugénie's deep
         passion should be analyzed in its most delicate fibres; for it became,
         scoffers might say, a malady which influenced her whole existence.
         Many people prefer to deny results rather than estimate the force of
         ties and links and bonds, which secretly join one fact to another in
         the moral order. Here, therefore, Eugénie's past life will offer to
         observers of human nature an explanation of her naive want of
         reflection and the suddenness of the emotions which overflowed her
         soul. The more tranquil her life had been, the more vivid was her
         womanly pity, the more simple-minded were the sentiments now developed
         in her soul.Made restless by the events of the day, she woke at intervals to
         listen to her cousin, thinking she heard the sighs which still echoed
         in her heart. Sometimes she saw him dying of his trouble, sometimes
         she dreamed that he fainted from hunger. Towards morning she was
         certain that she heard a startling cry. She dressed at once and ran,
         in the dawning light, with a swift foot to her cousin's chamber, the
         door of which he had left open. The candle had burned down to the
         socket. Charles, overcome by nature, was sleeping, dressed and sitting
         in an armchair beside the bed, on which his head rested; he dreamed as
         men dream on an empty stomach. Eugénie might weep at her ease; she
         might admire the young and handsome face blotted with grief, the eyes
         swollen with weeping, that seemed, sleeping as they were, to well
         forth tears. Charles felt sympathetically the young girl's presence;
         he opened his eyes and saw her pitying him."Pardon me, my cousin," he said, evidently not knowing the hour nor
         the place in which he found himself."There are hearts who hear you, cousin, and we thought you might
         need something. You should go to bed; you tire yourself by sitting
         thus.""That is true.""Well, then, adieu!"She escaped, ashamed and happy at having gone there. Innocence alone
         can dare to be so bold. Once enlightened, virtue makes her
         calculations as well as vice. Eugénie, who had not trembled beside her
         cousin, could scarcely stand upon her legs when she regained her
         chamber. Her ignorant life had suddenly come to an end; she reasoned,
         she rebuked herself with many reproaches."What will he think of me? He will think that I love him!"That was what she most
         wished him to think. An honest love has its own
         prescience, and knows that love begets love. What an event for this
         poor solitary girl thus to have entered the chamber of a young man!
         Are there not thoughts and actions in the life of love which to
         certain souls bear the full meaning of the holiest espousals? An hour
         later she went to her mother and dressed her as usual. Then they both
         came down and sat in their places before the window waiting for
         Grandet, with that cruel anxiety which, according to the individual
         character, freezes the heart or warms it, shrivels or dilates it, when
         a scene is feared, a punishment expected,—a feeling so natural that
         even domestic animals possess it, and whine at the slightest pain of
         punishment, though they make no outcry when they inadvertently hurt
         themselves. The goodman came down; but he spoke to his wife with an
         absent manner, kissed Eugénie, and sat down to table without appearing
         to remember his threats of the night before.
