      <field name="text">"The way the bourgeois novel confronts the problem of adultery may be compared to the two strategies for dealing with adultry
         in the Bible.  According to Old Testament Law, the adulterous man and woman are almost without exception to be excluded from
         society, canceled even to the point of execution.  In the New Testament, Christ confronted with the woman taken in adultery
         makes the would-be lawgivers aware of her problematical reality, calling into question both the impersonal application of
         the law and the justification and rights of the would-be legislators.  Effectively this implies the disintegration of society-as-constituted.
         (I shall return to these passages in more detail.)  In the bourgeois novel we can find a strictness that works to maintain
         the law, and a sympathy and understanding with the adulterous violator that works to undermine it.  (It is perhaps worth noting
         in passing that up to the end of the eighteenth century, adultery was an offense that could be, and still was, prosecuted
         in a court of law.  In the nineteenth century, though the law remained on the books, it was, I gather, never publicly prosecuted
         in a court of law—i.e., it moves to the unspoken realm and the punishments are applied and meted out privately.  This is another
         reason why adultery is one of the central problems for the bourgeois novel—unlike, for example, murder, which is arguably
         a greater threat to person, property, and law, but was never unspeakable in society and thus never undescribable in fiction.)
         What I have called the Old Testament and New Testament methods of confronting adultry may both be found operating within the
         same book, as I suggest they are in Anna Karenina.  Indeed it is arguable that it is just such a tension between law and sympathy
         that holds the great bourgeois novel together, and severe imbalance in either direction must destroy the form.What is implicit
         in all I have said so far is that marriage is the central subject for the bourgeois novel; not marriage as a paradigm for
         the resolution of problems of bringing unity out of difference, harmony out of opposition, indentity out of separation, concord
         out of discord—as it is, for instance, in A Midsummer Night's Dream, where marriage is not only social but magical, mythical,
         metaphysical—but just marriage in all its social and domestic ramifications in a demythologized society.  Or rather a society
         in which marriage is the mythology (at least the socially avowed one; it would be possible to say that money and profits made
         up a more secret mythology).  Marriage, to put it at its simplest for the moment, is a means by which society attempts to
         bring into harmonius alignment patterns of passion and patterns of property; in bourgeois society it is not only a matter
         of putting your Gods where your treasure is (as Ruskin accused his age of doing) but also of putting your libido, loyalty,
         and all other possessions and products, including children, there as well.  For bourgeois society marriage is the all-subsuming,
         all-organizing, all-containing contract.  It is the structure that maintains the Structure, or System (if we may use that
         word, for the moment, to cover all models, conscious and unconscious, by which society structures all its operations and transactions).
         The bourgeois novelist has no choice but to engage the subject of marriage in one way or another, at no matter what extreme
         of celebration or contestation.  He may concentrate on what makes for marriage and leads up to it, or on what threatens marriage
         and portends its disintegration, but his subject will still be marriage.  What he discovers, I will suggest, is that the bourgeois
         novel is coeval and coterminous with the power concentrated in the central structure of marriage.  As bourgeois marriage loses
         its absoluteness, its unquestioned finality, its "essentiality," so does the bourgeois novel.  On another level we may say
         that as the contact between man and wife loses its sense of necessity and binding power, so does the contract between novelist
         and reader.  This contract is still binding in Goethe; its abrogated in certain calculated ways in Flaubert (for example);
         it becomes extremely problematical in the work of the late James; and for Lawrence (and Joyce) we may say that the old contracts
         no longer have any force at all.  In confronting the problems of marriage and adultery, the bourgeois novel finally has to
         confront not only the provisionality of social laws and rules and structures but the provisionality of its own procedures
         and assumptions.The central importance of marriage makes it clear why it was adultery rather than seduction (or any of those
         other kinds of sexual behavior recorded, or imagined, in books like My Secret Life that became such a crucial subject.  The
         woman in the marriage situation becomes a paradigm for the problems of interrelating patterns.  To put it very simply, the
         woman as a biological entity cannot be changed (putting aside for the moment the problems of cultural 'sexing'); her organic
         determinants are given; the familial identifications of daughter and/or sister that are conferred on a female are not inherent
         qualities, but they are irremovable categorizations by the irreversible fact of consanguinity (this is Antigone's point about
         her relation to her brother in Sophocles' play).  But the category of being a wife is in no sense given even in the most conventionally
         prearranged marriages.  It is a totally social and cultural arrangement, and an arrangement on which society totally relies.
         It is at this point that we can see why so many problems of pattern converge on the figure of the wife.  We may put it this
         way.  Nature has her own patterns of seasonal and cyclical growth and decay, of mating impulses and fertilization processes;
         the family is a more stable and narrower pattern imposed on nature, while soicety is another pattern relating all the families
         according to intrafamilial and transfamilial rules.  In a religious age, which the bourgeois age notionally is, there is also
         the possibility of inscrutable divine patterns too large for any one human mind to grasp in their totality, but of which at
         certain moments—for Levin, at the death of a brother, the birth of a child—a man or woman may feel he has caught a glimpse.
         As these divine patterns are institutionalized, they will tend to be translated as being supportive of the existing social
         patterns.  To these the novelist adds his own pattern, not only to comprehend these various patterns but also to explore and
         illuminate the relationships, oppositions, and mediations between them.The most important mediation procedure that attempts
         to harmonize the natural, the familial, the social, and even the transcendental is, of course, marriage.  Thus, in a marriage
         you may participate in nature's pattern of coupling and breeding; but this can be incorporated within the existing interfamilial
         patterns and validated contractually by society.  It can also be sanctioned by the church.  Ideally, then, marriage offers
         the perfect and total mediation between the patterns within which men and women live.  One may immediately discern a potential
         tension between differing time schemes here.  For if nature works by generational changes (each particular family has to disintegrate
         to make sure the family continues with different members), while society—and here I am thinking specifically of bourgeois
         nineteenth-century society—tends to believe in what Sartre calls the myth of its own 'perenniality,' or permanence and stasis.
         Set in any one of these patterns, the life span of the individual mortal can mean, and be felt to mean, different things.
         If the mediation of marriage works, then everything is, as it were, at rest, all the patterns moving harmoniously together.
         It is the bourgeois ideal (an ideal that precludes the envisaging of possible patterns of historical and political change).
         But if something happens to disturb this mediation, or rather all the mediations that center on marriage, or to make them
         unacceptable or impossible, then a person involved may experience that anxiety or 'unhappy consciousness' that is a result
         of feeling he or she is participating in two or more irreconciable patterns, with no means of mediating them any longer" (14-17).
