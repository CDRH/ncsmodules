      <field name="text">CHAPTER XXIII The interior cabin, which appeared
         peculiarly appropriated to the use of Quadroona and her attendant, was fitted
         up in a style of gorgeous splendour, which was not without its effect upon the
         ardent imagination of William Linley even as he entered.Hangings of tapestry and rich Indian
         silks, mirrors, a sofa in the most luxurious Louis XIV style, arm chairs, a
         harp, a lute, books, nothing was wanting, while two elegant hammocks of Mexican
         grass hung above all, the favourite sleeping places of Creoles and white ladies
         in the hot countries of that sunny South, which, if it be the parent of much vice
         and fierce, untameable passions, is also the muster of wondrous beauty in what
         is living and what is inanimate.A large swinging lamp was suspended
         from the upper deck, filled with a fragrant oil that diffused its odour through
         every nook and cranny of the apartment. A table of elegant workmanship, covered
         with a profusion of silks and satins, stood in the middle of the room, most incongruously
         supported on each side by cannon; for even this delightful retreat was not
         without its especial use during the hours of peril and danger. Quadroona sat in a kind of chair of
         state, in a dreamy state of thought, which, at the moment, was evidently not
         pleasant. Her pouting, rich lips were compressed, her brow was slightly
         contracted, and she was tossing her tiny feet up and down in a way which; to
         one so impulsive, denoted that she was impatient, and almost angry.Standing
         beside her, in a long tunic, with bracelets on her arms and heavy earrings in
         her ears, was a mulatto woman of about thirty two or three, who had certainly
         none of the repulsive character which too often the unfortunate characteristic
         of the pure negress, but whose mixed blood had produced a kind masculine beauty,
         with an energy of character, rarely found, except under excitement, in the
         genuine African, after he has been reduced beneath
         the degrading yoke of slavery. William
         Linley hesitated."I
         am intruding," he said, with profound respect. "I
         have been expecting you." replied Quadroona, with a coldness of manner
         quite unsuited to her character. "Cora, give the gentleman a seat." The
         mulatto girl dropped the rich satin she had been admiring, and handed Linley a
         low settee, which he accepted with a bow. "Your
         arrival amongst us," said Quadroona, abruptly, "has been sudden. Do
         you come in the character of Wilder?" Linley
         understood her allusion. He coloured violently and rose to his feet. "I
         came, madame, on board by compulsion, and the first wish of my soul is to leave
         as soon as we reach any port whence England may be gained," he said, impetuously. "And
         why England — always England?" asked Quadroona, with a sudden change of
         manner. "Because
         there are my friends, my fortune, my home!" said Linley, proudly. He
         was about to have added, "my love," but some strange instinct
         checked him. Fatal error! "I know your story," she cried; "but sit down, I pray you. You are my
         tutor," she added, with a smile; "we must make acquaintance."William
         Linley looked at the supremely lovely apparition before him, and, as he sat
         down, there was a fluttering at the heart, which he stopped not to analyze. What
         young man of twenty would have not had his imagination fired by the prospect of
         continual intercourse with one so beautiful? Quadroona
         had all the indescribable fascinations of form and manner, the halo of
         passionate impulse, which is the birthright of the children of the South,
         combined with the polish which is acquired in the better circles of European
         society. As he gazed at her, William Linley felt her to be a mystery."What
         do you mean to teach me?" she said, in the tones of a queen interrogating a subject. "Before
         I answer, I must first ask you what you know," said William, with a smile."I
         can read!" said Quadroona, a little proudly."Any
         child would suppose that," answered Linley, with a measuring glance at the
         books which lay around.There
         was a strange wild flash in the eye of Quadroona, which Linley at the time was
         at a loss to understand."I
         can write," she added, turning the leaves of a large kind of album which she
         had suddenly caught up from the sofa near at hand.Linley
         rose and looked over the book."The
         writing is as neat as the hand is pretty," he said, with a smile.Quadroona
         raised her eyes, and fixed them upon him with an inquiring glance. It was
         clearly meant to ask him if his speech concealed a sneer. The sensitive nature
         of that strange and wayward being had evidently been aroused. The look with
         which Linley met her glance was so calm and smiling, that all suspicion
         vanished."You
         flatter!" she exclaimed, with a smile."Nay!"
         cried Linley, warmly, "'tis the writing of a perfect little lady. Did you
         learn in England?""In
         France," she replied, pettishly; "but the hand," she added, with a peculiar,
         a very peculiar glance, "is it so white?""No
         princess ever held out a fairer one to be kissed," said Linley, gallantly."Ay,
         some dusky Moor or burnt Spanish — ""Nay,"
         interrupted Linley, quickly; "the fairest daughter of France or England would be proud to own so fair a one.""But
         is it white?" asked Quadroona, laughing, but with an evident anxiety
         which did not escape Linley, however much it puzzled him."Would
         you, fair lady, have me call it black?" continued he, much amused with his
         wayward pupil."Black!"
         said Quadroona, fiercely, her face turning deadly pale, her nostrils dilating,
         her whole frame swelling with passion, "why should you call it black?"William
         Linley looked at her with a pitying glance, such as one might naturally bestow
         on one escaped from a lunatic asylum."Him
         black no such bad cullar," said the mulatto, tartly."Be not angry, Cora," replied Quadroona, as if remembering
         herself. "I do not say that black is a bad colour, but I have no wish
         to try it.""Him
         grandmudder black as one crow," said Cora, drily.Linley
         was shocked to see the effect of this statement on Quadroona. Every trace of
         gentle and feminine beauty departed for one moment; her eyes looked Medusa
         like, her lips parted, and, by exposing her teeth, gave her a fierce expression
         of hate; her skin, at first livid, showed, here and there, to the practised
         eye, the smallest tinge of black blood in the veins of woman."Cora,
         it is a lie of my enemies; my father was white, my mother was white!" she
         began, in choking accents."Fader
         white, certainly; so mine," continued the implacable mulatto girl: "but you
         mother half caste." "Mr.
         Linley!" cried Quadroona, in fierce accents, "call Captain Wharton!""Why?"
         said Linley, calmly."I
         will have this girl flogged!" almost shrieked the beautiful Quadroona."Flogged!"
         said Linley, with horror in his countenance."No
         dare!" cried Cora, coldly; "me free now!""Quadroona,"
         interposed Linley, more calmly, "allow me to speak one moment. I know not the
         reason of your anger, but this I do know, if I am to take upon myself the
         responsible position of your tutor, I must begin by expostualting with you
         against passion. You will never do credit to your evident high position, if
         you allow yourself to give way to such terrible impulses. Beauty and charms
         such as yours should surely be only the outward garb of all that is lovely
         within."All
         have seen the grey, cold, bleak horizon, when first tinged by the very faintest
         blush of dawn. The transformation is gentle and slow, indeed, but we soon feel
         the influence of the change. The dark and gloomy then, by slow degrees, is
         warmed into the full efflugence of day, until all is bright, sunny, glorious.So
         with Quadroona. Her pale and livid face became for a moment paler and more
         livid, and then changed to freezing chillness. The voice of the young man,
         however, was so gentle and persuasive that she was calmed — despite herself,
         the rosy colour came to her cheeks. She was herself again."Forgive
         me, Cora," she said, half reluctantly, "but I cannot hear of that unhappy
         tradition of my race without anger. It is a silly weakness, I know, but it is
         beyond my power to control it. I do not hate, however, all that is black.""Me
         no black!" cried Cora, who was quite as sensitive on the point as her mistress."I
         know — you are a mulatto.""My
         fader all white," said Cora — "my mother real African princess in her own
         country.""It
         matters little what people are in their own countries," continued Quadroona,
         musing — "but no more than this. Mr. Linley will pursue his catechism. I can
         play," she added, in a sprightly tone."Will
         you favor me?" asked Linley, who strove as much as possible to assume the tone
         of a master with his pupil.The
         experiment has been a dangerous one in all ages. The history of Heloise and
         Abelard is a common one. Youth and beauty on both sides — with master and
         pupil — and study will proceed but slowly. It is an old tale and often told."I
         can only accompany myself," she said, with a faint blush of timidity."Strange
         being!" though Linley; "so full of life and energy, so rife with southern
         passions, and yet so gentle and so timid."He
         rose meanwhile and adjusted the harp. As he did so, a deadly sickness came
         over him — a string gave way! Was it an omen? On the last occasion, when he
         had performed the same office for Lady Frances Herbert, a string had broken.
         It was truly touching a painful chord."You
         are ill?" said Quadroona, in a low, soft, seductive tone, that made the young
         man's life blood rush to his heart."No,"
         he replied, hurriedly; "'twas but a spasm." He
         sat down by her side and waited. Quadroona assumed her post near the harp, and
         never had Linley seen form so lovely, face so perfect, as when, with a dreamy
         and voluptous air of sincerity, she began chanting a kind of love ditty of the
         South.Her
         voice had all the softness requisite for her subject; it had also a compass and
         power which delighted and surprised her hearer. When she had finished, William
         Linley remained silent. His heart was too full to speak, the big tears stood
         unbidden in his eyes.Quadroona
         saw the effect she had produced, and, after enjoying her triumph for a moment,
         burst into a loud laugh."Pardon
         me!" cried Linley, starting; "but why do you laugh?""To
         see how silent you are. You would rather say nothing about my screeching, and
         therefore are dumb," she said, archly."Madame!"
         exclaimed Linley, who had not quite got rid of the spell, "I have heard many
         voices, but nothing so exquisitely has ever reached my ears. I fancy myself
         listening to some enchantress.""Mr.
         Tutor," said Quadroona, with mock gravity — in reality, deeply gratified — "if you
         teach me to be vain, who will school me?"Linley
         blushed. He had truly forgotten his relation to the fair enchantress — and
         very many other things besides."I
         can dance!" cried Quadroona, rising and clapping her hands, while Cora, at a
         sign from her, cleared a small open place.Linley
         stepped back, still more astonished, still more spellbound, still more
         fascinated than before.Quadroona
         had thrown herself into the attitude of a first class opera dancer — an
         attitude peculiarly calculated to show off her well rounded limbs, her full and
         perfect bust. As she stood smiling at him, the master thought the pupil the
         most dangerously seductive creature he had ever seen in his life. At least, he
         did not think so — he felt it, while thinking her the most beautiful vision his
         dreams had ever conjured up.She
         began dancing — no drawing room or salon dance of formal conventionality, but a
         dance in the true sense of the word. She began with slow, languishing, and
         measured movements, that seemed a narrative in themselves. Her eyes darted
         liquid fire, her bosom panted, her mien was all luxurious enjoyment. Then
         anger seemed to rise: she started back, stood upright with a menacing mien,
         and then began, with inimitiable art, to simulate an angry beauty gradually
         yielding to the pressing solicitations of her lover for pardon. At last every
         flash of anger vanished, and gave way to a soft, ductile, yielding look, as of
         beauty vanquished, until, after whirling wildly round, she fell exhausted in
         her arm chair.Linley
         stood upright against the wall. He had never seen such an exhibition before.
         The southern and impassioned girl was a novelty to him. A wild thought darted
         through his brain — his kindled imagination compared her with the cold
         daughters of the North — and again, but with redoubled vigour, came the
         fluttering sensation to his heart which he had already felt so keenly. He
         closed his eyes to escape the vision of so much beauty, but she appeared only
         more lovely to his mind's eye."Now,
         Mr. Linley," she said, suddenly, in a natural and calm tone of voice, which
         awoke him rudely from his dream, "you know my accomplishments.""That
         dance came not from France?""From
         France— no!" she cried, with considerable animation. "The dances I learned
         in their schools I hate. They are so formal — so solemn. What I like is
         liberty — liberty of speech, of act, of limb. I submit to the dry walking you
         call dancing, but I love to cast off restraint, and find joy in the free use of
         my hands and feet.""The
         dance is peculiar," continued Linley; "to what clime does it belong?""To
         my native country," said Quadroona, drily.Linley
         bowed, but could not avoid making mental note of the reservation with which she
         spoke of her native land. It was one peculiarity among the many that
         surrounded him. His ideas were in a whirl. He had, during a few hours, passed
         through so much action and incident, that he had no time for thought.Who
         was this beautiful and fascinating creature? Whence came she? Whither was she
         going?The
         questions flashed across his mind with lightning rapidity, but Quadroona, who
         noticed his abstracted air, gave him no time for much reflection."And
         now, my master!" she cried, "that you know what I can do, please inform me of
         the order of my studies.""Madame,"
         replied Linley, quickly, "I, too, have my duties to learn. They are
         many, I believe, and arduous. My experience of the sea is confined to yachts,
         so that I am no practised sailor. I must give my mornings to instruction
         myself. But you have books, you can read; you have a harp, you can play; you
         have a voice, you can sing." Here he hesitated."You
         would not advise me to dance?" she said, archly."Madame,"
         replied Linley, laughing to hide his confusion, "I fancy the wind will not
         always be as favourable as it is now.""You
         object?" said Quadroona, gravely, with a searching glance; "you fancy that
         dance bold and unbecoming?""No!"
         exclaimed Linley, warmly, "not so. It is but unusual. I never saw anything so
         graceful or fascinating on or off — "He
         hesitated."The
         stage," put in Quadroona, gravely. "There," she added, passionately, "there
         speaks the selfishness of your northern men. Women with you are painted dolls
         or slaves — slaves to conventionality or custom. You love to see the graceful
         dance, the rounded limb, the elegant form — but it must be the graceful dance,
         the rounded limb, the elegant form, of hirelings and foreigners. You encase
         your wives, sisters, and daughters, in coats of mail, and long, hideous skirts
         that prevent all motion. Who would ride a spirited horse with a panoply around
         fit only for a pope or cardinal? Give me the warm and sunny South, where the
         spirits are high, and where cold and formal customs chain not woman.""Women
         in most southern countries are slaves indeed!" said William Linley, gravely.Quadroona
         started, bit her lip, and turned pale."True,"
         she said, after a moment's pause; "'tis only in the North their persons and
         wills are free. But you punish them for the liberty you give, by chaining them
         to social laws and rules, which make them as much slaves as in any country
         where the hideous traffic is real.""You
         have never been in England," replied Linley, warmly, "where at least the
         influence of woman is legitimate and great.""England! Always England!" said Quadroona, warmly. "Tell me of that fabulous land
         which I
         have never seen — shall never see," she added, with a sigh.Linley
         spoke, and Quadroona scarcely ever interrupting him, he sketched, as far as was
         in his power, the position of woman in our favoured isle. To him, probably, the
         picture was brighter than the reality, but he was correct in estimating his
         country women and their North American sisters as fortunate above all. We are
         far from perfect, but the social position of the fair sex, their standing in
         society, their influence is far more legitimate and real in this favoured isle,
         than it is elsewhere in the whole wide world.A
         superficial glance at continental countries may create another impression, but
         those who have gone beyond a shallow study know the contrary.Quadroona
         listened with wrapt attention. The picture evidently pleased her."Englishwomen
         should be happy!" she said, at last, with a deep sigh. "But are there no
         unhappy marriages, no forced unions, no hateful conjunctions of unkindred
         souls?""Many;
         but I believe fewer than people fancy."Quadroona
         made no reply, and Linley, who thought the topic rather a dangerous one,
         changed the subject to the less exciting subject of her studies. He had
         scarcely done so when Wharton returned, and bowing gracefully to both Linley
         and Quadroona, asked Cora to give them tea, a beverage which both appeared to
         be fond of. Cora rang a bell, and a lad about fourteen, also a black,
         appeared, bringing the necessary apparatus."And
         now, Mr. Linley," said Captain Wharton, rising; "your watch begins at twelve.
         I think you will need rest. You have made your arrangements for the
         prosecution of this young lady's studies? You can continue tomorrow."Linley
         took the hint and retired, Captain Wharton following him in a very few minutes.
