      <field name="text"> The Making of Lovemaking As they pursued the women of their choice, [Victorian men]
         individually reflected the romantic and sexual ideals
         of the day. If [they] were not generally poets, some at
         least dipped into the outpourings of others, as did
         many of the women they desired. Still more people
         nourished their romantic longings on best-selling
         fiction. Meanwhile, songs and other entertainments,
         greeting cards, love letters, courting customs, and
         marriage manuals also fostered the relationship of the
         sexes. Romantic sexual love was a constant, often
         public presence in Victorian life and popular
         consciousness. Inevitably this helped to shape people's
         expectations and behavior in their private
         relationships. The creation in this way of a widely
         influential romantic ideal was physical lovemaking's
         cultural foreplay—the making of
         lovemaking.Thrilling Through Every Fiber The men and women of romantic fiction set the pace. In the
         typical fashion of his kind, Captain Ainsley Falkland,
         hero of  Taken by Storm, an 1885
         novel serialized in the London Journal, puts his strong
         arms around the heroine, Beryl, and prepares to "ravish
         a kiss from her palpitating lips." She in turn responds
         characteristically to his "sweet
         kisses"—quick to feel the thrill of physical
         arousal, the Victorian romantic heroine thrived on
         passion. "With love's joyous impulse," Beryl nestles
         her head rapturously on her lover's breast. "'My own
         Ainsley,' she murmurs, clinging to him in a perfect
         abandon of love's mystic emotions, that thrills through
         every fibre of her being."Other fictional couples were equally devoted and open in
         showing their feelings. In the early episodes of
         Charles Reade's A Terrible Temptation
         , an 1871 Cassell's
         Magzineserial, the two principal characters, Sir
         Charles Bassett and Miss Bella Bruce, are newly engaged
         and mutually smitten: Every day he sat
         for hours at the feet of Bella Bruce, admiring her
         soft feminine ways and virgin modesty, even more
         than her beauty. And her visible blush whenever he
         appeared suddenly, and the soft commotion and
         yielding in her lovely frame whenever he drew
         near, betrayed his magnetic influence, and told
         all but the blind she adored him. But even
         from the blind Bella's passion was no secret. She would
         also "prattle her maiden love like some warbling
         fountain" or, seized by emotion, exclaim to Charles,
         "'I love, and honor, and worship, and adore you to
         distraction, my own—own—own!'"Bella and Charles, Beryl and Ainsley, and countless fictional
         couples like them helped to direct the course of
         real-life heterosexuality. Each of the stories in which
         such characters figured might have been enjoyed by a
         million or more readers. A Terrible
         Temptation  and his other tales of love made
         Charles Reade at least as popular as Dickens. Whether
         concocted by Reade or more obscure writers, romance was
         rife in Victorian fiction. The reading public had only
         to open a cover and turn a page or two, and there would
         be the ideal of romantic love created and re-created in
         compelling plots and illustrations of perfect, happy
         couples. Romance All Around In an age when print was the major source of mass
         entertainment, fiction played the single greatest role
         in the making of lovemaking. But other pastimes also
         made their collective contribution. Those with the
         leisure and means to attend art exhibitions might feast
         their eyes and feed their fantasies on paintings of
         attractive couples in settings of rustic beauty.
         Improving methods of reproduction made such images
         available to an ever-wider public. People passing to or
         from work might pause over portraits of lovers
         displayed in the windows of print shops, or stop at a
         newsagent's to browse through the array of illustrated
         magazines that regularly pictured romantic
         scenes—a picnic for two, an umbrella shared
         on a rainy day, or an intimate outing on a secluded
         river. The new art of photography also assisted the
         cause of love by capturing the memory of the warm sun
         and embraces that went with a day off from work, spent
         courting in a park or at the seaside.Photography offered yet another possibility for keeping
         romance on people's minds. One of its offshoots was
         among the most popular of entertainments in the
         middle-class home. This was the stereograph, which
         consisted of two identical photographic images paired
         together. Viewed through a stereoscope, the forerunner
         of the twentieth-century Viewmaster, the double image
         resolved into a single three-dimensional picture. The
         London Stereoscopic Company (motto: "A stereo-scope for
         every home") and other suppliers offered a wide variety
         of stereographic images for their customers'
         viewing—everything from the wonders of
         ancient Egypt to current events. One of the most
         popular subjects was the relationship of the sexes. The
         scenes were generally staged using actors or models
         posing in studio settings. The tone might be sad
         ("Broken Vows") or sentimental ("The First Love
         Letter") or humorous, as in the episode of the suitor
         who hides under his young lady's crinoline. Whether
         they inspired tears or titters, the three-dimensional,
         often color-tinted stereographs showing love between
         the sexes gave romance a tangible presence in many
         Victorian parlors.Romance also made itself felt through another parlor fixture,
         the piano. During the nineteenth century such
         instruments became ever cheaper to manufacture, so that
         by 1880 they were featured in virtually every
         middle-class household. They were also prestigious
         additions to the parlors of the most prosperous
         artisans and tradespeople. In middle-class families at
         least one female member normally knew how to
         play—such accomplishment was a common part of
         a girl's education. In an informal evening's
         entertainment involving the family or a few guests, one
         or more of the young ladies might play love songs while
         others present would listen, perhaps sing along, or
         quietly let their imaginations stray into pleasurable
         realms.The piano also provided an opportunity for young people to
         enact the rituals of courtship safely in public view,
         yet with a modicum of delicious privacy. While parents
         or chaperons occupied themselves with card games or
         conversation, a young woman and her suitor could enjoy
         the physical closeness that the piano encouraged. She
         played, he stood nearby, from time to time bending
         nearer still to turn a page and breathe in her perfume.
         New love could thus grow, nurtured by the parlor piano
         and its romantic strains.While the piano and stereograph were regular fixtures in the
         making of love-making, there were also special
         occasions, and on these the greeting card took over.
         Apart from seasonal motifs, Christmas and New Year's
         cards often introduced a note of romance. In one, a man
         takes a woman into his arms under the mistletoe, while
         a fragment of verse completes the action—"he
         pressed her, kiss'd her, caress'd her." Another card
         offered a lighter look at love. It shows a man and
         woman embracing on a city street; at the same time a
         servingwoman from an adjacent house empties a bucket
         whose contents—water, or worse,
         maybe—are about to hit the amorous pair. The
         card's message reads, "May there be no damper on your
         pleasure at this festive season."The high holiday for the exchange of romantic greeting cards
         was February 14. The popularity of the valentine grew
         rapidly in the Victorian period, and the mid-February
         flow of cards increasingly strained the capacity of the
         Post Office. In 1841 the English sent a total of
         400,000 valentines; by 1871 the figure had risen to one
         and a half million for London alone. Valentines ranged
         in quality and price. At sixpence, the most affordable
         had simple woodcut illustrations enhanced by a
         half-dozen or so basic colors. Expensive varieties
         costing several shillings were often exquisitely
         beautiful, rich in color and decoration—gold
         or silver leaf, ribbon, lace made of paper or fabric,
         tiny silk flowers with pearlized leaves, pieces of
         plush velvet, and pink and gold embossed cupids were
         among the embellishments used on these lavish tokens of
         love.Some valentines were whimsically romantic. Particularly
         popular in the 1860s and 1870s were facsimiles of Post
         Office telegrams. Bearing the legend "Love Office
         Telegraphs" and an insignia of two cupids, they were
         stamped with the post-mark "Loveland, Feb. 14." The
         engraved messages of more conventional valentines were
         often short and direct: "I love but thee." "Accept my
         heart." "Affection's token." "Adoration." A few struck
         a chord of sadness—"I hide my love while it
         consumes me" but most were optimistic: "Happv Love."
         "Ever True." "Yours unalterably." Still others,
         elaborated their sentiments in line, of romantic
         verse:How prized the coral and the shell, And beautiful the pearl,Who can the hidden treasure tell,O'er which the soft waves
         curl.Yet dearer still art thou to me, Than all in air, or earth, or sea. The common practice was to send valentines unsigned
         or with
         initials only. The Victorian sexual mystique demanded a
         little mystery, even if it was only symbolic, and the
         recipient knew full well who was the sender. Romantic
         though it was, this secretiveness is a bit unfortunate.
         It is now often impossible to determine even the sex of
         the sender, let alone his or her identity. Still, there
         are occasional revealing exceptions. Among those
         distinguishable by gender were three men who inscribed
         their own words of love among the embossed hearts and
         printed sentiments they sent to the women they loved.
         The ink of these handwritten feelings is now faint, but
         their sincerity still resonates clearly across the
         years. "Accept this token of constancy from your most
         devoted." "With best wishes and sweet kisses." And,
         simply, "My dear, from GC, 13/2/1856."Quivering Lips and Blooming
         BlushesImportant though they were to the Victorians, there was more
         to the making of lovemaking than the sentiments and
         trappings of romance. At the real heart of the matter
         was sex. In A Terrible
         Temptation, Bella on occasion punctuates her
         fervent declarations of love for Charles by "flinging
         herself passionately yet modestly on his shoulder." Her
         passionate modesty was not a contradiction in terms but
         one of the many demonstrations of the Victorian gift
         for the decorous cultivation of sexuality.Especially gifted in this way were the many writers of
         fiction who celebrated biology with propriety. Not
         uncommonly, but discreetly of course, they evoked the
         imagery of female sexual parts. In describing Bella's
         beauty, Charles Reade gave loving attention to her
         mouth. Searching his imagination, he saw "two full and
         rosy lips. They made a smallish mouth at rest, but
         parted ever so wide when they smiled, and ravished the
         beholder." In writing  Taken by
         Storm, the author gave his hero Ainsley a
         constant desire to "sip the nectar" from Beryl's
         "pretty" and "quivering" lips. Some readers would have
         taken such passages strictly at the face value they
         ostensibly presented. Others would have responded to
         the sexual connotations of ravishing or quivering lips,
         and let their mind's eye stray downward. "Ravish" and
         "quiver" both had suggestive meanings, while alluring
         facial lips were respectable symbols of a more
         fundamental erogenous zone.Indeed, the language of such symbolism compared closely to
         the more literal-minded descriptions in pornography.
         The difference was that pornographers gave short shrift
         to faces and devoted themselves directly to other "fair
         lips" and "pink slits," A reference or two to "dewy
         moisture" or "sucking the honey of love" completed the
         picture. True to type, the voyeuristic narrator of  The Disembodied Spirit  was
         quick to fix his gaze in the direction of what lay
         between the "quivering thighs" of his current object of
         desire. Soon his "eyes dwelt on ... a pair of scarlet
         pouting lips, whilst the soft mound above thrilled as
         if longing for some unknown pleasure."Lacking the literalism of pornography and its relentless
         taste for the objectification of people, popular
         fiction exercised greater inventiveness in the
         treatment of sexual themes. It made much of blushing,
         for instance. Whenever in the presence of her
         fiancé, Charles, Bella blushes visibly.
         Beryl's great love for Ainsley suffuses her complexion
         with "brilliancy." Similarly, "roseate hues," "vivid
         blushes," and "love's colors" constantly "steal" into
         the faces of most other romantic heroines in the throes
         of passion. It was no accident that feminine blushing
         was one of the preferred motifs of the Victorian
         romance. Second only, perhaps, to the palpitating
         bosom, it identified the true womanly woman.In 1900 Havelock Ellis's "scientific" analysis of the blush,
         part of  Studies in the Psychology of
         Sex, confirmed what had long been popular
         consensus on the subject. Blushing was first of all a
         sign of female modesty, a desirable trait in heroines
         and real-life women alike. It was also in itself
         appealing. In February 1858 the author of the advice
         column in  Cassell's Magazine 
         assured a concerned young woman that her blushes were a
         distinct romantic asset: "That face which has lost the
         power to blush, has also lost the power to
         charm—true men." Beyond adding to a woman's general attractiveness, the blush
         was also specifically sexual. Ellis and others before
         him argued that physiologically it was virtually the
         same as the "general rosiness" of the sexual flush and
         directly comparable to the "erection of sexual organs."
         It was thus a signal of arousal and, for the unmarried,
         an appropriate sex substitute. Small wonder that
         fiction made much of feminine blushes as beacons of
         arousal, they undoubtedly titillated readers and
         stimulated authors' sales.It almost goes without saying that heroes did not blush. In
         and out of fiction, real men controlled their
         sexuality, emotions, and bodily responses—or
         so they were supposed to do. At times this was
         difficult, even for heroes. Ainsley found Beryl
         "perfectly irresistible" and could not stop himself
         from "ravishing" her lips. Indeed, she was "possessed
         of such power over him" that he gave up a fortune to
         marry her, "his only earthly treasure." Charles was
         also overcome by his passion for Bella. On those
         occasions when she "flung herself passionately" upon
         him, he was weakened to the point of feeling "highly
         gelatinous" and bereft of "all power of resistance."
         His coloring, though, remained unchanged.But if even in the heat of passion men were constrained to
         suppress their own blushing, at least they were always
         at liberty to take a prurient manly interest in the
         blushes of women. This the poet Joseph Ashby-Sterry
         acknowledged, although with less than lyric greatness.
         In "A Breezy Ballad," part of his anthology for the
         boudoir, he is delighted with "Old March" wind who
         "romps with skirts and dresses," revealing "snowy
         frills" and provoking a "wealth of blooming blushes /
         Seen through tangled mass of hair!" Here were not only
         blushes, but suggestively tangled hair, ladies'
         unmentionables, and romping—a favorite
         activity of the sexual adventurer. The poet had in fact
         created an entire erotically charged scenario.Writers of romantic fiction could be just as thorough. Take
         the 1870  Bow Bells serial  Morton's Fate, a simmering mix
         of passion, murder, revenge, separation, and mistaken
         identity. Marion and Walter, her divorced husband and
         now her lover once more, are together in Paris and
         about to marry again. But Marion knows what Walter
         cannot—that their love is destined always to
         be thwarted in life. She determines to put an end to
         this dire fate by poisoning first him, then herself. As
         the story ends, they die in each other's arms,
         "passionately entwined as one."Their final, intense encounter on this earth is imbued with
         unspoken sexual appetite. After dining intimately in
         Marion's boudoir, they set to "dallying daintily" with
         "rich fruits" contained in silver baskets upheld by
         nude figurines, and spread sensuously over the table.
         She plays the guitar and sings "a tender love ditty."
         The accompanying illustration is also infused with the
         characters' sexual love. Physical union the dominant
         motif, the figures' eyes are locked; she leans back
         against his legs. His arm is thrust out, his hand
         stroking her hair. Apart from its possibly phallic
         connotation, Marion's guitar is the visual device
         joining their two bodies. In the making of Victorian
         lovemaking, passion was no abstraction. With or without
         actual intercourse, it was a bodily reality, integrally
         bound up with living—and, in Marion and
         Walter's case, with dying as well. Sex Symbols Outside of the privacy of the bedroom, the passionate fever
         pitch that romantic fiction could reach was not
         regularly surpassed. But while Victorian sexuality was
         not always openly intense, it was still a constant if
         often coy presence in romantic life.February 14 provided a formal occasion for some tantalizing
         glimpses—eroticism was not far from the
         surface of the frills and sentiment of many valentines.
         In the verse about hidden treasure, "coral" had a
         possibly suggestive association with "coral lips," that
         much-loved image of both romantic and pornographic
         fiction. "Pearl," meanwhile, was a symbol of female
         sexuality and figured often in valentine poetry and
         ornament. Another popular motif was the glove, either
         in the form of a paper miniature pasted to the card or
         an entire valentine shaped like a glove. The motif
         signaled a man's serious romantic interest in the
         recipient, and often it was an unspoken
         proposal—"prelude to a Ring." Additionally,
         as casings into which bodily parts were inserted,
         gloves were inescapably colored with erotic overtones.
         Not surprisingly, they were among the most beloved
         objects of sexual fetishists.The air of fetishism also lingers about a tiny lady's lace
         nightcap, complete with real pink silk ribbons, mounted
         on the paper lace background of yet another valentine.
         The image was not a common one, but the
         message—"Good night dear"—captured
         a recurring theme. Valentine verses were frequently
         evocative of beds and going to bed. Female breasts were
         invariably the "pillows" where men longed to lay their
         heads, while their women lulled them into "balmy rest"
         and "soothing sleep." Weary from "playing the game" all
         day, the Victorian man apparently sometimes needed
         sleep more than sex. Also, perhaps, he occasionally
         confused being sexual with being mothered.Finding a mother substitute does not appear to have been
         foremost in the minds of the young men who gathered
         around that bare-legged center of courtship the parlor
         piano. Beyond its connection with innocent romance, it
         was where male sexuality sometimes aggressively
         asserted itself. The piano as a scene of seduction
         showed up in Victorian painting—most notably,
         William Holman Hunt's  The Awakening
         Conscience (1853)—and in popular
         magazine illustrations of the day. As an  instrument, the piano was also
         the object of ribald humor. In the comic song "Tuner's
         Oppor-tuner-ty," the piano tuner takes a more than
         professional interest in his client, Miss Crotchety
         Quaver, a young woman whose versatile "playing"
         requires regular tuning service:And to keep her piano in tune she would
         have A good tuner constantly there,And he'd pull up the instrument three times a
         week, Just to keep it in proper repair. Chorus: And first he'd tune it gently, then he'd tune
         it strong, Then he'd touch a short note, then he'd run
         along, Then he'd go with vengeance, enough to break
         the key, At last he tun'd whene'er he got an
         op-por-tu-ni-ty.Like many other comic songs, this one was sold as a song
         sheet and performed, with appropriate gestures no
         doubt, on the music hall stage. There the nudging,
         winking style of entertainment enjoyed considerable
         license. Clothed in humor, the making of lovemaking
         could "go all the way" in full view, with the general
         approval of a mass audience. Typically bawdy was an
         1890s song called "Starve Her, Joe." It begins with a
         married man, Joe, whose domestic tranquility is
         disrupted by the extended visit of his wife's mother.
         Driven to distraction, he contemplates starving the
         offending in-law to death. Quickly coming to his
         senses, he abandons this plan and instead seeks solace
         with Flo, an attractive lady barber with, as Joe puts
         it "such a goo-goo eye / I lay back my head and sigh."
         He then launches into a full-frontal chorus:Lather! lather! lather me, Flo!Your little brush, it tickles me so-o-o! But please
         don't hurt that pimple below When you start to lather me, Flo!As Joe and most of the audience well knew, "pimple" had two
         meanings—one of which was "a swelling."Although it did not necessarily go to the lubricious lengths
         of the music hall, sexual humor still found a place
         offstage. The repertoire of stereographic entertainment
         included a lot of light-hearted
         naughtiness—the suitor under the crinoline,
         the monk with his naked female "provisions," husbands
         dallying with pretty French maids, and so on.
         Valentines also had their moments of comic
         suggestiveness. In one vignette a hoydenish young woman
         (with an impressively large bottom) tries on a type of
         men's breeches known as peg-tops. The humor rested on
         the double meaning of "peg"—once clad in the
         trousers, the young woman is disappointed to find
         something missing. "Oh dear there's nothing in 'em,"
         she exclaims: Call these Peg topsthen I beg You'll tell me where to find the Peg. Cleaving Together While many Victorians
         were never averse to a little sexual
         humor, most did not allow themselves to be long
         diverted from sexuality's serious purpose—the
         procreative marriage. As biology proceeded along a
         decorous course toward matrimony, there were certain
         rituals and conventions to be observed. Women had their
         ways of signaling marriage-mindedness—eye
         contact, blushing, flirting—but men usually
         made the actual proposal. "Man proposes (or at least
         should do so) and woman disposes," was the wisdom of
         the day, and few would have thought to challenge it.
         The heroes of fiction and their counterparts in
         everyday life produced gold rings with a flourish, or
         fell to their knees in romantic entreaty, or otherwise
         declared their matrimonial intentions. "Name the day
         ... that makes thee mine" was the plea of many men who
         sent valentines, while the poet Ashby-Sterry ended his
         "Lover's Lullaby" on a similar note:Mirror your fate, then, in mine, love; Sorrow and sighing resign:Life is too short to
         repine, love, Link your fair future in mine!Although there were always exceptions and variations
         according to class, the general expectation was that
         the engagement was the time for a couple to enjoy
         increasing physical intimacy, but to stop short of
         premarital sexual intercourse. As the wedding date
         approached, those who adhered to this regime of going
         just so far, but not the whole distance, found their
         sexual tension growing and their restraint weakening.
         Men and women alike thus looked forward eagerly to the
         wedding night. Of course, anticipation did not mean
         that there were no prenuptial anxieties. For all her
         genuine passion, Charles Kingsley's bride-to-be Fanny
         confessed to a certain amount of fear mixed with her
         sexual yearning. Her groom meanwhile was wrestling with
         his own worry. "The blaze of your naked beauty," he
         confided anxiously, might dazzle him into
         impotence.As it turned out, all went well in the Kingsleys' conjugal
         bed. Sexual gratification was in fact what a majority
         of about-to-be-married Victorian couples optimistically
         looked forward to. Pictures and verses in wedding cards
         represented this hopeful longing and the imminent joys
         of consummation. A card from the 1880s depicts a bride
         and groom in their bedroom, alone at last, kissing
         tenderly. "What...oft they dreamt, and oft they longed
         for" was about to become, as the card's poet expressed
         it, "reality at last":And the veil, in sweet caresses, Yields to love's most ardent touch; Gently then they draw the curtain
         To hide love's secret with a blush.Even pornography, usually unsentimental, was apt to soften a
         little when it turned to the theme of newly wedded
         bliss. A turn-of-the-century pornographer's catalogue
         of "Photographic Novelties" unctuously advertised a
         series of images of "The First Wedding Night": "The
         preludes of love, the clever caresses, the endless
         ecstacies and then the carnal refinements, the search
         after the new, the unknown and lastly prostrated, the
         felicity of the total initiation."After the first joys of consummation had subsided, sex
         remained at the core of the healthy Victorian marriage.
         Not everyone experienced sensual fulfillment as intense
         as that of the Kingsleys—what made for a
         happy sexual relationship varied from couple to couple.
         Still, there were broad guidelines for establishing and
         maintaining appropriate and rewarding marital
         relations. Those who sought sexual knowledge or the
         improvement of their conjugal lives could always turn
         to one of the many manuals whose advice helped to shape
         marital lovemaking.Frequency of intercourse was a standard theme. The experts,
         mostly physicians and doctors of divinity, agreed that
         sexual moderation was the ideal and that excesses were
         to be avoided. This view arose not out of prudery but
         in part out of a belief in the necessity of spermatic
         economy—the end result of the overexpenditure
         of seed might be the moral, intellectual, and physical
         degeneration of the human race. Or so believed a number
         of commentators, among them Sylvanus Stall, who wrote
         several sex manuals published in Canada, England, and
         the United States. In  What a Young
         Husband Ought to Know(part of an 1897-1902
         series called Sex and Self), Stall, like other
         authorities, was concerned for the general health of
         couples. Too much sex, he cautioned, might be "most
         ruinous" to the health of the wife and lead to a host
         of fearful conditions in the husband: "backache,
         lassitude, giddiness, dimness of sight, noises in the
         ears, numbness of fingers and paralysis."But how much was too much? The experts were not entirely
         dogmatic and, to a point, allowed for individual
         preferences and circumstances. Most offered some
         general direction as well. A few recommended relations
         every twenty to thirty days. A greater number
         considered once a week to be sounder practice for
         maintaining a satisfactory bond of "mutual affection"
         between husband and wife. Pregnancy, however, changed
         matters. By and large, greater than usual moderation
         was the rule, although Stall advocated complete
         abstinence.It is impossible to know with any certainty the extent to
         which Victorian couples followed the experts' advice,
         and how often most actually made love—there
         were then no national polls or statistical averages. In
         1892 Dr. Clelia Mosher of Stanford University conducted
         a survey of about forty-five middle-class American
         women. Her sampling was too small to permit sweeping
         conclusions, but it is not unreasonable to take it as a
         general indicator of more widespread behavior among the
         prosperous middle classes. On average the women
         reported having sex once a week, while a few indulged
         more often. At the lower ends of the economic scale, it
         is probably likely that frequency declined. Exhausting
         labor, poverty, and lack of privacy were not conducive
         to sexual activity.Sex and the Married WomanThe writers of marriage manuals tended to overlook the
         existence of an impoverished working class. In the
         world of sex experts the ideal of the well-off
         middle-class family reigned supreme. From such a
         privileged vantage point, the feeding of extra mouths
         was not an overriding concern, and the ready consensus
         was that the primary purpose of sex was procreation.
         Sexual feeling, wrote Dr. Mary Wood-Allen in her 1899
         advice book  What a Young Woman Ought
         to Know, "is the indication of the possession
         of the most sacred powers, that of the perpetuation of
         life. Passion is the instinct for preservation of one's
         kind, the voice of the life principle, the sign of
         creative power."But the reproductive purpose of sex did not mean a negation
         of pleasure. Dr. Wood-Allen was quick to refer
         approvingly to "throbbing and pulsing in every fibre."
         In Stall's opinion, pleasure was one of the strongest
         arguments for moderation. Indulge "every slight
         inclination" and oversatiation would be the unhappy
         result, but exercise a degree of moderation and
         "realize the greatest pleasure and satisfaction." Dr.
         R. T. Trall, author of  Sexual
         Physiology,published in 1870, counseled
         people to set aside whole days for making love. Whether
         the object of such activity was a "love embrace merely"
         or a "generative act," he was convinced that it should
         be pleasurable to husband and wife alike. "Surely," he
         insisted, "if sexual intercourse is worth doing at all,
         it is worth doing well."It is one of those enduring myths about the Victorians that
         sexual pleasure was a disproportionately male
         enjoyment, and that women on the whole were
         indifferent. The misconception arose principally out of
         the work of the now notorious Dr. William Acton, an
         "expert" on the "evil habit" of masturbation and other
         sexual matters. In his 1857 treatise,  The Functions and Disorders of the Reproductive
         Organs, he pronounced with chauvinist
         certainty that "the majority of women (happily for
         them) are not very much troubled with sexual feeling of
         any kind." Of course, he admitted with spurious
         fair-mindedness, there were exceptional women who
         experienced "sexual excitement." But this, he hastened
         to add, invariably progressed to "nymphomania, a form
         of insanity which those accustomed to visit lunatic
         asylums must be fully conversant with."Acton was read widely in his day, and his opinions were
         undoubtedly given some credence. For instance, they
         validated the asexuality that was simply some women's
         nature. Perhaps they also alleviated the guilt of those
         in whom ill health had diminished sexual interest. But
         many Victorian authorities on sexuality had grave
         doubts about Acton's views and even his competence.
         Others simply ignored him and propounded their own
         ideas. Stall for one considered that the "largest
         number" of women took at least moderate pleasure in the
         sex act. He also acknowledged another, smaller group
         "in whom sexuality presides as a ruling passion....
         Such women should never be married except to men of
         good health, strong physique, large powers of
         endurance, and with a pronounced sexual
         inclination."He also described a third group that on the surface appears
         to be indistinguishable from Acton's sexually
         anesthetic women. But a closer look shows that Stall
         did not regard some women's sexual coldness as either
         inevitable or healthy. It was a correctable condition
         whose causes were varied. Indigestible food, late
         hours, and general debility from too little fresh air
         and exercise all contributed to sexual malaise. So,
         too, did excessive novel-reading, tight lacing, and
         chronic constipation. He did not say so directly, but
         the implication is also there that some women might
         have overreacted to Acton and his misogynist kind and
         come to believe that frigidity was very nearly a
         virtue.Not least of all, Stall blamed ignorance. Of this both
         husband and wife might be guilty, but the greatest onus
         for knowledge and consideration he placed on the man.
         Ignorance could lead to clumsy and unintentionally
         brutal lovemaking on the husband's part—and
         on the wife's, permanent aversion. An informed and
         considerate approach, Stall maintained, would make all
         the difference between a "disgusted" bride and "a union
         of lifelong happiness." Quoting from Mrs. Eliza B.
         Duffey, a contemporary authority on "the relations of
         the sexes," he counseled new husbands to "practice in
         lawful wedlock the arts of the seducer rather than the
         violence of the man who commits rape, and you will find
         the reward of your patience very sweet and
         lasting." Getting Satisfaction No doubt many Victorian husbands never became as well versed
         as they ought to have been in the fine art of wife
         seduction. Even so, their wives were not necessarily
         sexually unsatisfied. Quite the opposite, often. In
         fiction just-married heroines typically took on "new
         beauty" or "the blossom of wifehood"—the
         signals of recently discovered physical satisfaction.
         In a more forthright vein, greater than a third of the
         women in Dr. Mosher's survey reported experiencing
         orgasm "always" or "usually"; another 40 percent said
         "sometimes" or "not always." Even among the remaining
         women—about a quarter of the whole
         group—there were some who at least
         occasionally felt arousal.Other middle-class American wives indicated general sexual
         contentment through their language and tone in letters
         to their husbands. One woman wrote playfully to her
         absent husband in the summer of 1873: "How are you this
         hot day? I am most roasted and my chemise sticks to me
         and the sweat runs down my legs.... don't you wish you
         could be around just now." Another wife's sexual
         longing was too great for teasing. "I like you to want
         me, dear," she wrote to her husband in 1883, "and if I
         were only with you, I would embrace more than the back
         of your neck, be sure."For all their expressiveness, these women, the many others
         like them, and the men with whom they exchanged loving
         letters all preserved a characteristically Victorian
         reticence when it came to what, precisely, gave them
         erotic pleasure. Even most marriage manuals were
         unforthcoming about the mechanics of lovemaking. Stall,
         among others, says nothing on the subject. Such
         discretion need not be narrowly interpreted as prudery,
         nor even as fastidiousness with regard to subject
         matter. Saying nothing about the technical particulars
         served the sexual mystique of the day. It left room for
         variation and experimentation, as long as no one
         violated the general rule of mutual pleasure.At least one expert, however, was more explicit—and
         dogmatic. This was a French medical man, Auguste Debay,
         the author of  Hygiene et physiologie
         du mariage, published in 1848 and reprinted
         throughout the century. Debay insisted that the only
         "natural" and "normal" way of making love was in the
         missionary position. His conviction arose from an
         assumption of general male superiority as much as it
         did from a notion of appropriate intercourse. In bed or
         elsewhere, men "naturally" belonged on top. Many of his
         contemporaries no doubt agreed and, coincidentally or
         not, enjoyed sex in the missionary position.
         Nevertheless, it is hard to imagine the populace of a
         country famed for its lovemaking unanimously and
         invariably obeying Debay's authoritarian stricture.And, looking across the Channel, it appears no less
         inconceivable that upon marriage, versatile English
         eroticism could universally subside into missionary
         monotony. Kingsley for one had a lively sexual
         imagination. How could he have been content with
         marital relations limited to the missionary
         position—even though he undoubtedly had a
         tendency to mix religion with sex. Take off your
         clothes and pray, he had once suggested to Fanny. "Then
         lie down, nestle to me, clasp your arms and every limb
         around me, and with me repeat the  Te
         Deum aloud." Eccentric Anglican clergyman
         though he might have been, Charles Kingsley was no
         puritan missionary.Whatever the ways in which individual couples chose to make
         love, the joys of marriage, including its physical
         side, were ideally supposed to last. In his manual for
         young husbands, Stall hinted at "the later years" of
         marriage, which could bring with them "the largest
         possible good and blessing." In 1901 he would follow up
         the hint with a further volume, What
         a Man of 45 Ought to Know. Romantic fiction
         offered a similarly optimistic view, and many of its
         couples continued to enjoy "perfect bliss" and
         "passionate devotion" long after marrying.In real life, frequency of intercourse perhaps declined over
         time—or so the Mosher survey suggests but in
         many marriages, romance and sexual pleasure endured
         throughout the years. Among the love letters preserved
         from Victorian America, a number attest to the
         longevity of marital passion. In 1856 Nathaniel
         Hawthorne, famed author of  The
         Scarlet Letter and other novels, expressed
         the fervid sentiments of many when he declared to his
         wife of fourteen years: Oh, dearest,
         dearest, interminably and infinitely
         dearest—I don't know how to end that
         ejaculation. The use of kisses and caresses is,
         that they supersede language, and express what
         there are no words for. I need them at this
         moment—need to give them and to receive
         them.Not unexpectedly, Hawthorne's enthusiasm was perhaps exceeded
         only by the erotic devotion of Kingsley. During a brief
         separation in the first year of his marriage, he
         tantalized his wife with the question, "Shall we the
         first night we meet reenact our marriage night?" "Oh!"
         he exclaimed, "to be once again with you—to
         lie once more naked in your arms." A half-dozen years
         later, in May 1850, separation still made him
         physically long for her. "These soft, hot damp days
         fill me with yearning love," he wrote. "Your image
         haunts me day and night as it did before we were
         married, and the thought of that delicious
         sanctuary"—but here the fantasy breaks off.
         No less passionate but more discreet than her husband,
         Fanny had carefully inked over his amorous
         revelation.To the Bridal Altar Go While most Victorian husbands might not have been as
         articulate as Kingsley, there were many as
         passionate—and with wives as compatible as
         Fanny. As the nineteenth century progressed, more and
         more people strove toward this conjugal ideal. The
         number of marriages grew during the Victorian years, as
         the marital norm became increasingly central in the
         making of lovemaking. Common-law arrangements
         progressively decreased until they survived only among
         the poorest, who tended to keep quiet about their
         irregular circumstances. For those of means marriage
         had longer been the established norm, but it was more
         firmly entrenched than ever by the turn of the
         century.Some advertising did not fail to use the norm to its own
         advantage. An attractive pictorial advertisement for
         Pears' Soap featured the image of a young woman sitting
         in a field and plucking petals from a daisy.
         Superimposed were a few lines of appropriately
         "romantic" verse:A Maiden's Wishes —are but three.O'er all the world, whoe'er she be—To handsome grow,And have a beau,And
         to the bridal altar go—All these fruitions of her hopeCome quickly if she'llUSE PEARS' SOAPWith or without the help of Pears'
         Soap, women not only
         increasingly got married but, as far as their families
         could afford, ever more favored elaborate and colorful
         weddings to mark the day. In the last two decades of
         the nineteenth century, bridesmaids wore colored gowns,
         instead of the traditional white. For brides, the
         shades of preference were cream or ivory, rather than
         stark white; other popular choices were by later
         standards startling—claret velvet,
         purplish-brown satin, gray corded silk. In contrast,
         the bridegroom and his attendants became less colorful.
         As the popular notion of masculinity grew more rigid,
         the male members of the wedding party gave up shades of
         blue, claret, and mulberry. By the 1890s the only
         acceptable color for a frock coat was black. Not everyone was happy with the ideal that middle-class
         weddings represented. Here and there the voices of
         dissent spoke out against the marital norm. A number of
         late-Victorian feminists were critical of marriage and
         its embedded premise that women were property. These
         and other women also wanted greater educational and
         political rights, as well as marital reform. In 1893
         still others—men as well as
         women—founded the Legitimation League to
         protest against conventional marriage, advocate free
         love, and demand legal rights for children born out of
         wed-lock. Meanwhile, the majority of men and women took
         little notice of these voices. As the century ended,
         they were absorbed in falling in love and planning
         romantic weddings.In yet another sphere, still far removed from most common
         experience, the sexologists were at work distinguishing
         and describing the "normal" and the "pathological,"
         turning sex into definitions of standard or deviant
         modes of behavior—talk, that is. Although
         their efforts escaped the attention of most people,
         there appeared a few signs in everyday life that sex
         was already less a total affair of the body than it had
         been not long before. By 1900 new, matter-of-fact
         fictional heroines tended not to blush, or at least not
         so readily as their predecessors. Suitors, accordingly,
         were not so apt to turn "gelatinous" in their presence.
         At the same time, the odd sex manual was inclined to
         equate sexual love with effective technique, rather
         than with individual passion and bodily response. But even as the nineteenth century gave way to the next, such
         signals were still sporadic and faint. The making of
         lovemaking retained most of its old devotion to
         passion. At once profoundly romantic and physical, the
         mystique of carefully nurtured eroticism had not yet
         dissolved into analytical talk. Throughout the
         Victorian age, for countless lovers, both courting and
         married, sex radiated much of the "sweetness and light"
         that the poet and moralist Matthew Arnold envisioned in
         a perfect world. Inevitably, though, in a less than
         perfect reality there were unlit places shadowy corners
