         The Wetton ScandalThe Hero of the Mobile Sensation Arrested for BigamyThe Indianapolis, Ind., News relates
         the following later developments in the Wetton scandal sensation of Mobile, Ala., an account of the first exposure of which
         appeared with illustrations in the Gazette
         some weeks since.Last night C. Albert Wetton, ex-auditor of one
         of the Mobile railroads, was arrested in this city by Chief of Police Travis
         and Captain Forbes on a warrant based on a grand jury indictment against the
         gentleman for bigamy. Wetton and his wife lived happily together for several
         years in Mobile, and as he was in receipt of a salary of 5,000 they were
         enabled to maintain a fine establishment. About a year ago he formed the
         acquaintance of Mrs. Mary Jane Hartpence, the wife of an Indianapolis printer
         by the name of Walter Hartpence. Last fall he obtained a Utah divorce from his
         wife without notifying her of the fact, and after having, as he supposed,
         legally ridden himself of her, persuaded her to take a trip to California. He parted with her at St. Louis on Friday, November
         16, 1877, leaving her to
         make the journey alone, and started back in the general direction of Mobile. By some means the suspicions of the wife became
         aroused and instead of going on to the Golden State she returned to the South after a delay of a day or two. On leaving his
         wife Wetton came to this city and late Saturday night routed up County Clerk Brown from whom he obtained a marriage license,
         Receiver Hunt, of
         the Grand Hotel, making the necessary affidavits. Mary Hartpence had been
         granted a decree of divorce during the previous September by Judge Julian, and
         both supposing that every legal bar to their union had been removed, were
         married on the afternoon of Sunday, November 18, in the parlors of the Second
         Presbyterian Church, Rev. W. A. Bartlett officiating. The singularly married
         couple went South, and it so chanced that they encountered wife No. 1 in a
         sleeping car. A scene followed which was graphically illustrated in the Police
         Gazette shortly after. Wetton lost his situation by reason of the scandal
         growing out of this episode, and removed to Ohio with wife No. 2.At the last term of the grand jury in this city
         a bill for bigamy was returned against Wetton, and several days ago his true
         wife came here with the expressed purpose of prosecuting her unfaithful
         husband. She decoyed him to this city by giving him to understand that she
         wanted to arrange with him for the procurement of a legitimate divorce. He fell
         into the trap readily, arriving from Cincinnati last evening. He had been
         expected on the noon train but missed connections. The outraged wife was very
         anxious to have him arrested, but once in the hands of the police she appeared
         very solicitous to get him out of trouble.This morning Wetton was visited by his wife, who
         is now only too willing to compromise provided her husband will give up the
         "other woman," get employment and take her back to his arms again. The case
         has gone beyond her control. Wetton's bail was fixed at $1,000, which he has
         been unable to furnish. The prisoner is a man about thirty-five years of age,
         of very prepossessing appearance and fine address. He is much torn up over his
         arrest.
