         "Early nineteenth-century reformers, popular literature, and even some of the more scientific studies stressed seduction and
         abandonment as a major cause of prostitution, a reason that accorded with some prostitutes' explanations.  In the typical
         scenario, women were portrayed as pure, trusting, and affectionate, while men were characterized as unprincipled lechers.
         An example of this sentimental approach to seduction is found in Sanger's mid-century study:
         A woman's heart longs for a reciprocal affection, and, to insure this, she will occasionally yield her honor to her lover's
         importunitites, but only when her attachment has become so concentrated upon its object as to invest him with every attribute
         of perfection, to find in every word he utters and ever action he performs but some token of his devotion to her.
         Love then became a 'passion' and an 'idolatry' that developed gradually in the woman 'until the woman owns to herself and
         admits to her lover that she regards him with affection.'  Although such an acknowledgment should have inspired the lover
         with high resolve to protect her, it frequently became instead:
         the medium for dishonorable exactions . . . fatal in consequences to her, [as he] tramples on the priceless jewel of her honor.
         It should be remembered that, in order to accomplish this base end, he must have resorted to base means. . . . Pure and sincere
         attachment would effectively prevent the lover from performing any act which could possibly compromise the woman he adores.
         There were usually two possible endings to the typical story of deception:  the young girl was immediately forsaken after
         the illicit sex, or she was induced to elope with the young man and shortly afterward abandoned and left to fend for herself
         in a new city.  It was said that most of these young women then turned to lives of prostitution, either because they had lost
         all self-respect or because their families and friends, on learning of their sins and indiscretions, disowned them and turned
         them out. . . .Many stories of seduction reinforced the popular notion that men, even apparently trustworthy men, were really
         lechers.  The New Era in October 1837 told of Mary Burke, a victim of a variety of men across the professional spectrum, who
         was arrested in a Walnut Street [New York City] brothel.  Burke told the judge that she had been born in Ireland, where her
         schoolmaster had seduced her when she was fourteen.  Because of her sin, she was thrown out by her father.  She bore a child
         and moved to Quebec, where she became intimate with her confessor, a Catholic priest, which resulted in another child.  She
         then moved to Montreal, was seduced by a constable, had a third child, and eventually went to the Grey Nunnery with her children.
         Later, she came to the United States with another man who abandoned her in New York, and there, because of economic need,
         she began a 'business of her own.'. . .[F]ew explanations of a woman's fall could elicit as much sympathy as that of seduction
         and abandonment.  Seduction certainly played a decisive role in causing some women to enter prostitution, but its frequency
         was probably overstated by reformers and possibly by the women themselves, who may have wanted to justify their stituation
         to reformers who favored such explanations.  In Sanger's study of 2,000 prostitutes, approximately 13 percent gave 'seduced
         and abandoned' as their reason for entering prostitution.  A few more said they were 'seduced on board emigrant ships' or
         were 'seduced in emigrant boarding houses,' but the total number reporting seducation as a reason still represented only 14.5
         percent of the cases.Entrapment and trickery, followed by rape, was
         another scenario said to lure women into prostitution, one believed especially
         effective with immigrants and young women from rural areas. Joe Farryall was a
         typical 'professional' recruiter whose guile was said to have caused the ruin
         of many innocent young women. Farryall and his wife, Phebe, operated a house
         of prostitution on Franklin Street and kept it supplied with inmates from as far
         north as Vermont.Periodically, Farryall traveled through the countryside and,
         either through his charms or by promises of a better and more exciting life,
         persuaded young women to follow him to New York, where they were raped or
         intimidated into sexual compliance. Men like Farryall were rumored to be
         getting from $50 to $500 per recruit. Another method of tricking young country
         girls and newly arrived immigrants was by promising training and work in
         millinery or other trades. Only after arriving at the designated employment
         address in the city would a woman discover the true nature of the
         establishment" (68-72).
