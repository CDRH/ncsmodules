      <field name="text">CHAPTER III:  Rachel LiscombRachel Liscomb, daughter of Deacon
         Liscomb—tall, slender, straight, with black hair and dark eyes, a
         brunette—looked at him one day as they walked home from meeting, with a look
         that he never got over.  She was one of the few without gifts of speech,
         whose bearing and looks are a full equivalent for speech. A farmer's
         daughter—she was well-practised in work. But, a New-England woman, she was
         of a deep moral nature and reflectively intelligent. One who looked
         for attractive manners would pass her
         by unseen. Like a geode, the exterior was homely, the crystals were
         dark-chambered within.Upon
         her rested the thoughts of Abiah Cathcart. She went but little from home,
         except on Sunday to church, and to the singing-school. But twice had Cathcart
         visited her father's house, and yet for a year, when they met, both hid or
         strove to hide a sensibility of which neither was ashamed, but which each was ashamed to feel without some sign that the
         other felt it too. Our finer feelings are like the evening primrose, all the
         sunlight but shuts them closer. And yet, when evening comes and dews are
         falling, if you will watch, you shall see the twilight with gentle influence
         unroll them one by one, with visible motion, each blossom throwing forth, as it
         opens, its offering of delicate odor.They
         were walking silently and gravely home one Sunday afternoon, under the tall
         elms that lined the street for half a mile. Neither had spoken. There had been
         some little parish quarrel, and on that afternoon the text was, "A new
         commandment I write unto you, that you love one another." But, after the
         sermon was done, the text was the best part of it. Some one said that Parson
         Marsh's sermons were like the meeting house—the steeple was the only thing that folks could see after they got home.They walked
         slowly, without a
         word. Once or twice 'Biah essayed to speak, but was still silent. He plucked a flower from between the pickets of the fence,
         and unconsciously pulled it to pieces, as, with
         troubled face, he glanced at Rachel, and then, as fearing she would catch his
         eye, he looked at the trees, at the clouds, at the grass, at everything, and
         saw nothing—nothing but Rachel. The most solemn hour of human experience is not
         that of death; but of Life—when the heart is born again, and from a natural heart becomes a heart
         of Love!  What wonder that it is a silent hour and perplexed?Is the soul confused? Why
         not, when the divine spirit, rolling clear across the aerial ocean, breaks upon
         the heart's shore with all the mystery of heaven?  Is it strange that
         uncertain lights dim the eye, if above the head of him that truly loves hover
         clouds of saintly spirits?  Why should not the tongue stammer and
         refuse its accustomed offices, when all the world—skies, trees, plains, bills,
         atmosphere, and the solid earth—spring forth in new colors, with strange
         meanings, and seem to chant for the soul the glory of that mystic Law with
         which God has bound to himself his infinite realm—the law of Love!  Then,
         for the first time, when one so loves that love is sacrifice, death to self,
         resurrection, and glory, is man brought into harmony with the whole universe;
         and like him who beheld the seventh heaven, hears things unlawful to be uttered!The
         great elm trees sighed as the fitful breeze swept their tops. The soft shadows
         flitted back and forth beneath the walker's feet, fell upon them in light and
         dark, ran over the ground, quivered, and shook, until sober Cathcart thought that
         his heart was throwing its shifting network of hope and fear along the ground
         before him!How strangely his voice
         sounded to him as, at length, all his emotions could only say, "Rachel—how did you like the sermon?"Quietly she answered—"I
         liked the text.""'A new commandment I write unto you, that ye love one another.' Rachel, will you help me keep it?"At first
         she looked down and lost a little color; then, raising her face, she turned upon him her large eyes, with a look both clear
         and tender. It was as if some painful restraint had given way, and her eyes blossomed into full beauty.Not another word was
         spoken. They
         walked home hand in hand.  He neither smiled nor exulted. He saw neither the trees, nor the long level rays of sunlight that
         were slanting across the fields. His soul was overshadowed with a cloud as if God were drawing near. He had never felt
         so solemn. This woman's life had been entrusted to him!Long
         years—the whole length of life—the eternal years beyond, seemed in an
         indistinct way to up in his imagination. All that he could say, as he left her
         at the door, was:"Rachel, this is
         forever—forever."She
         again said nothing, but turned to him with a clear and open face, in which joy
         and trust wrought beauty.  It seemed to him as if a light fell upon him
         from her eyes.  There was a look that descended and covered him as with
         an atmosphere; and all the way home he was as one walking in a luminous cloud. He
         had never
         felt such personal dignity as now. He that wins such love is
         crowned, and may call himself king. He did not feel the earth under
         his feet. As he drew near his lodgings, the sun went down. The children began
         to pour forth, no longer restrained. Abiah turned to his evening chores.
         No animal that night but had reason to bless him.  The children found him
         unusually good and tender. And
         Aunt Keziah said to her sister:"Abiah's keen goin' to meetin' very regular for
         some weeks, and I shouldn't wonder, by the way he looks, if he had got a hope.
         I trust he ain't deceivin' himself." He had a hope, and he was
         not deceived; for in a few months, at the close of the service one Sunday
         morning, the minister read from the pulpit: "Marriage is intended between
         Abiah Cathcart and Rachel Liscomb, both of this town, and this is the first publishing of the banns."  Which notice was duly
         repeated for two
         successive Sunday mornings.  Then old Uncle Bascom, the town clerk,
         issued the marriage certificate. Uncle Bascom had been town clerk, the
         boys used to think, ever since there was a town; so long that that town,
         without Giles Bascom as clerk, wouldn't be recognized. It was one of
         the marks, like the meeting-house, the brick store, and Gallup's tavern, by
         which people knew that this was the town of Dennis.One
         day there appeared in the county paper two lines: "Married:—On—, at the home of the bride's father, Abiah Cathcart
         and Rachel Liscomb."
