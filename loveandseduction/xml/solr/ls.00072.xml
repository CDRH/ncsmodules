      <field name="text">Scene Two: Maggie and Stephen's erotic encounter, from music room to lawnMaggie was seated in the
         drawing-room, alone, shortly after dinner, with Minny on her lap, having left
         her uncle to his wine and his nap, and her mother to the compromise between
         knitting and nodding, which, when there was no company, she always carried on
         in the dining-room till tea-time. Maggie was stooping to caress the tiny silken
         pet, and comforting him for his mistress's absence, when the sound of a
         footstep on the gravel made her look up, and she saw Mr. Stephen Guest walking
         up the garden, as if he had come straight from the river. It was very unusual
         to see him so soon after dinner! He often complained that their dinner-hour was
         late at Park House. Nevertheless, there he was, in his black dress; he had
         evidently been home, and must have come again by the river. Maggie felt her
         cheeks glowing and her heart beating; it was natural she should be nervous, for
         she was not accustomed to receive visitors alone. He had seen her look up
         through the open window, and raised his hat as he walked toward it, to enter
         that way instead of by the door. He blushed too, and certainly looked as
         foolish as a young man of some wit and self-possession can be expected to look,
         as he walked in with a roll of music in his hand, and said, with an air of
         hesitating improvisation,—"You are surprised to
         see me again, Miss Tulliver; I ought to apologize for coming upon you by
         surprise, but I wanted to come into the town, and I got our man to row me; so I
         thought I would bring these things from the 'Maid of Artois' for your cousin; I
         forgot them this morning. Will you give them to her?""Yes," said
         Maggie, who had risen confusedly with Minny in her arms, and now, not quite
         knowing what else to do, sat down again.Stephen laid down his hat,
         with the music, which rolled on the floor, and sat down in the chair close by
         her. He had never done so before, and both he and Maggie were quite aware that
         it was an entirely new position."Well, you pampered
         minion!" said Stephen, leaning to pull the long curly ears that drooped
         over Maggie's arm. It was not a suggestive remark, and as the speaker did not
         follow it up by further development, it naturally left the conversation at a
         standstill. It seemed to Stephen like some action in a dream that he was
         obliged to do, and wonder at himself all the while,—to go on stroking Minny's
         head. Yet it was very pleasant; he only wished he dared look at Maggie, and
         that she would look at him,—let him have one long look into those deep, strange
         eyes of hers, and then he would be satisfied and quite reasonable after that.
         He thought it was becoming a sort of monomania with him, to want that long look
         from Maggie; and he was racking his invention continually to find out some
         means by which he could have it without its appearing singular and entailing
         subsequent embarrassment. As for Maggie, she had no distinct thought, only the
         sense of a presence like that of a closely hovering broad-winged bird in the
         darkness, for she was unable to look up, and saw nothing but Minny's black wavy
         coat.But this must end some
         time, perhaps it ended very soon, and only seemed long, as a minute's
         dream does. Stephen at last sat upright sideways in his chair, leaning one hand
         and arm over the back and looking at Maggie. What should he say?"We shall have a
         splendid sunset, I think; sha'n't you go out and see it?""I don't know,"
         said Maggie. Then courageously raising her eyes and looking out of the window,
         "if I'm not playing cribbage with my uncle."A pause; during which Minny
         is stroked again, but has sufficient insight not to be grateful for it, to
         growl rather."Do you like sitting alone?"A rather arch look came
         over Maggie's face, and, just glancing at Stephen, she said, "Would it be
         quite civil to say yes?""It was
         rather a dangerous question for an intruder to ask," said Stephen,
         delighted with that glance, and getting determined to stay for another.
         "But you will have more than half an hour to yourself after I am
         gone," he added, taking out his watch. "I know Mr. Deane never comes
         in till half-past seven."Another pause, during which
         Maggie looked steadily out of the window, till by a great effort she moved her
         head to look down at Minny's back again, and said,—"I wish Lucy had not been obliged to go out. We lose our music.""We shall
         have a new
         voice to-morrow night," said Stephen. "Will you tell your cousin that
         our friend Philip Wakem is come back.  I saw him as I went home."Maggie gave a little
         start,—it seemed hardly more than a vibration that passed from head to foot in
         an instant. But the new images summoned by Philip's name dispersed half the
         oppressive spell she had been under. She rose from her chair with a sudden
         resolution, and laying Minny on his cushion, went to reach Lucy's large
         work-basket from its corner. Stephen was vexed and disappointed; he thought
         perhaps Maggie didn't like the name of Wakem to be mentioned to her in that
         abrupt way, for he now recalled what Lucy had told him of the family quarrel.
         It was of no use to stay any longer. Maggie was seating herself at the table
         with her work, and looking chill and proud; and he—he looked like a simpleton
         for having come. A gratuitous, entirely superfluous visit of that sort was sure
         to make a man disagreeable and ridiculous. Of course it was palpable to
         Maggie's thinking that he had dined hastily in his own room for the sake of
         setting off again and finding her alone.A boyish state of mind for
         an accomplished young gentleman of five-and-twenty, not without legal
         knowledge! But a reference to history, perhaps, may make it not incredible.At this moment Maggie's
         ball of knitting-wool rolled along the ground, and she started up to reach it.
         Stephen rose too, and picking up the ball, met her with a vexed, complaining
         look that gave his eyes quite a new expression to Maggie, whose own eyes met
         them as he presented the ball to her."Good-bye," said
         Stephen, in a tone that had the same beseeching discontent as his eyes. He
         dared not put out his hand; he thrust both hands into his tail-pockets as he
         spoke. Maggie thought she had perhaps been rude."Won't you stay?"
         she said timidly, not looking away, for that would have seemed rude again."No, thank you,"
         said Stephen, looking still into the half-unwilling, half-fascinated eyes, as a
         thirsty man looks toward the track of the distant brook. "The boat is
         waiting for me. You'll tell your cousin?""Yes.""That I brought the music, I mean?""Yes.""And that Philip is come back?""Yes."
         (Maggie did not notice Philip's name this time.)"Won't you come out a
         little way into the garden?" said Stephen, in a still gentler tone; but
         the next moment he was vexed that she did not say "No," for she moved
         away now toward the open window, and he was obliged to take his hat and walk by
         her side. But he thought of something to make him amends."Do take my arm,"
         he said, in a low tone, as if it were a secret.There is something
         strangely winning to most women in that offer of the firm arm; the help is not
         wanted physically at that moment, but the sense of help, the presence of
         strength that is outside them and yet theirs, meets a continual want of the
         imagination. Either on that ground or some other, Maggie took the arm. And they
         walked together round the grassplot and under the drooping green of the
         laburnums, in the same dim, dreamy state as they had been in a quarter of an
         hour before; only that Stephen had had the look he longed for, without yet
         perceiving in himself the symptoms of returning reasonableness, and Maggie had
         darting thoughts across the dimness,—how came he to be there?  Why had she come
         out?  Not a word was spoken. If it had been, each would have been less intensely
         conscious of the other."Take care of this step," said Stephen at last."Oh, I will go in
         now," said Maggie, feeling that the step had come like a rescue.
         "Good-evening."In an instant she had
         withdrawn her arm, and was running back to the house. She did not reflect that
         this sudden action would only add to the embarrassing recollections of the last
         half-hour. She had no thought left for that. She only threw herself into the
         low arm-chair, and burst into tears."Oh, Philip, Philip, I
         wish we were together again—so quietly—in the Red Deeps."Stephen looked after her a
         moment, then went on to the boat, and was soon landed at the wharf. He spent
         the evening in the billiard-room, smoking one cigar after another, and losing
         "lives" at pool. But he would not leave off. He was determined not to
         think,—not to admit any more distinct remembrance than was urged upon him by
         the perpetual presence of Maggie. He was looking at her, and she was on his arm.But there came the
         necessity of walking home in the cool starlight, and with it the necessity of
         cursing his own folly, and bitterly determining that he would never trust
         himself alone with Maggie again. It was all madness; he was in love, thoroughly
         attached to Lucy, and engaged,—engaged as strongly as an honorable man need be.
         He wished he had never seen this Maggie Tulliver, to be thrown into a fever by
         her in this way; she would make a sweet, strange, troublesome, adorable wife to
         some man or other, but he would never have chosen her himself. Did she feel as
         he did?  He hoped she did—not. He ought not to have gone. He would master
         himself in future. He would make himself disagreeable to her, quarrel with her
         perhaps. Quarrel with her?  Was it possible to quarrel with a creature who had
         such eyes,—defying and deprecating, contradicting and clinging, imperious and
         beseeching,—full of delicious opposites?  To see such a creature subdued by love
         for one would be a lot worth having—to another man.There was a muttered
         exclamation which ended this inward soliloquy, as Stephen threw away the end of
         his last cigar, and thrusting his hands into his pockets, stalked along at a
         quieter pace through the shrubbery. It was not of a benedictory kind.
