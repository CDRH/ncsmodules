      <field name="text">1."Carnal relations between young people have always been tolerated by the working
         classes in Western Europe, on the express condition that they are followed soon
         afterwards by marriage" (97).2. "This freedom of behaviour, specific to the working classes, was determined by one
         element: the 'promise of marriage'. Only this promise, which in traditional practice
         bound the man by his word of honour, could authorize pre-marital sexual relations. It
         thus traced the real dividing line between permissible and delinquent conduct"
         (98).3. "The given word was still invested with such symbolic importance that it was enough
         merely to pronounce in private, orally or by letter, for our young women to regard it
         as a solemn oath. Of course we have no exact transcripts of these declarations, made
         at the moment of engagement or during the sexual act. But it seems reasonable to
         suppose that young women would have expected something formal, probably no more than
         'I promise to marry you'. Whatever the actual phrase, it appears to have retained its
         contractual significance even when uttered during the blaze of sexual passion, or not
         even pronounced until after the act" (100).4. "What was the setting for these sexual frolics?  For the most part, they seem
         to have
         occurred in everyday surroundings, in the workplace or at home. Romantic billets-doux, the exaltation of grand passion, are
         not much in
         evidence here. Quite often the act was performed in the workplace, in the lodger's
         room or in the home of the girl's parents. The house would perhaps have been empty,
         with some people on holiday or on a visit, others at work, the children asleep.
         People would make love in places where they spent a lot of time: domestics, for
         example, in the kitchen, others in their rooms. This was especially true where the
         couple both worked for the same employer or lived in the same lodgings: the normal
         setting was the girl's room, or the boy's room, or the kitchen; sometimes as
         'upstairs' room or the servants' hall" (102-3).5. "Skilled workers, shop assistants, commercial travelers, policemen and other
         categories close to the petty bourgeoisie were the first to acquire a taste for
         Sunday outings in the country. Among domestics, sexual advances were more often
         inspired by the change of scene during their employers' holidays" (105).6. "The Hansom cab, that enclosed public place whose
         steady progress reminded the couple
         of their imminent separation, was the scene of many seductions:He took me home in a cab and effected his purpose of violence
         as we
         were returning.We occasionally walked out and in December he took me in a cab
         where Crim. Con took place.He seduced me in Aug 1866 in a cab we were going from Uxbridge to
         Gerrards X...Father seduced me in a cab as we were out. C.C. was repeated in the
         same manner and he also took me to a coffee house" (105-6).7. "A popular song composed and sung by the famous musical hall
         artiste Arthur Lloyd
         suggests that a girl could change her mind at any moment, and that the culprit would
         then be punished for his persistence:I followed her home and to speak to her tried,She said 'Why d'ye follow me?' and I replied,'I
         love you dear girl and would make you my bride,'You Know!...Then she said, 'Well, I like you, but silence beware!You know!I've
         a very stern parent his bedroom's up there! You know!'I struggled to kiss her, she gave a loud cry,I heard a door open and
         ere I could fly,A very hard fist struck me twice in the eye! You know!...A policeman appeared and exclaimed 'What's all this?'
         You
         know!'Oh,' said I, 'a young girl I was trying to kiss!' You
         know!To the station he marched me at a very quick pace...His Worship exclaimed, when the case he had tried,'Forty shillings
         or one month' with horror I cried'Forty shilling or one month, for whatâ€”' he
         replied:'You know!' (109)8. "One last hypothesis: the public admission of indecisiveness, of humming and hawing
         at the moment of the sexual act, may be the first sign of a new, more modest
         attitude, or perhaps susceptibility to guilt about pre-nuptial sex" (112).
