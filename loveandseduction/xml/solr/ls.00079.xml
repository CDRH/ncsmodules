         "Sexual unspeakability does not function simply as
         a collection of prohibitions in Victorian writers. Rather, it affords them
         abundant opportunities to develop elaborate discourse—richly ambiguous,
         subtly coded, prolix and polyvalent—that we now recognize and designate by
         the very term literary. Like other restrictions upon expression, the
         conventions of sexual unspeakability serve writers as a productive constraint,
         contributing to a certain historical formation of the literary. Literature in
         turn supplies a culturally privileged repository for the production, and
         recognition, of sexuality as unspeakable" (3).2. 
         "In the Victorian period, scandals of all sorts
         proliferated in the popular press. In part as a result of the repeal of the
         stamp tax in 1855 and the paper duty in 1860, the number of newspapers in Great Britain multiplied, and they became cheaper,
         more widely available, and more national
         in scope. This burgeoning medium generated stories for popular consumption on
         a scale that had not been possible before, and the character of both newspapers
         and news itself changed significantly. The papers' greater availability,
         coupled with increasing literacy, made scandals publicly accessible in new
         ways" (6).3. 
         "I suggest that scandal assumes its modern form
         only once several conditions are met: that news media are national and
         accessible; that they distance the subjects of their stories from their
         audience enough to effect a divide between the exposed private life and the anonymous
         public reading about it; and that the audience itself is conceived in terms
         sufficiently capacious to encompass a wide range of class, gender, and
         geographical positions" (6-7).4. 
         "While it ought to be obvious, it has not been
         remarked that scandal, often sex scandal, structures the usual plot of the
         realist novel in the Victorian period. The typical story of the Victorian
         novel involves the loss and eventual recovery of a fortune, benefactor, parent,
         child, sibling, or spouse. The course of recovery necessitates disclosure of a
         secret, which has been hidden because it is in some way immoral or illegal;
         most often, it involves adultery or illegitimacy. The plot of the novel
         unfolds by threatening and finally effecting the exposure of this secret to the
         community, and once this revelation has occurred, the goods (property, family)
         are redistributed, now more justly, among those who survive. The novelistic
         plot, distilled in this way, is analogous to the form of the scandal" (16-17).5. 
         "The connections between novels and newspaper
         scandal stories are not only structural, though; they arise from the deeply
         intertwined histories of the two forms, as the work of recent literary critics
         has made clear. Scandal and the novel derive, according to these accounts,
         from a common ancestor, and the history of the novel has involved a series of
         efforts actively to dissociate itself from the taint of scandal" (18).6. 
         "The scandal plot is so persistent, I suggest,
         because it provides a way of working out the novel's own double duty: the duty
         of telling stories composed centrally of incidents from private life and,
         simultaneously, of using these stories to teach widely applicable public
         lessons. Scandal motivates a type of moral pedagogy in the novel, generating
         exemplary narratives that both school readers in acceptable behavior and enable
         them to experience vicariously the violation of norms. Novels toe the orthodox
         line in castigating sexual transgression by the same means that they occasion
         its pleasurable consumption. Through the critique of scandal's procedures in
         which they frequently engage, moreover, literary works provide readers the
         thrill of following scandal while exempting them from the discomfort of being
         scandalized" (19).
