         A RICH BREACH OF PROMISE CASE
         The Story of the Fair Eleanor and the Heartless Lorenzo
         ELEANOR'S WOUNDS ARE HEALED WITH $8,000 DAMAGES
         A Sad Story of Love and Cruelty—Seduction and Adultery in High LifeAugusta, Me., Nov. 25, 1867.—An occurrence has recently
         taken place in this city of which I find it my duty to keep the readers of the National
         Police Gazette posted, since its columns are eagerly scanned in this
         vicinity for anything that is rich, rare, and racy. The item I refer to so
         much overtops all other local matters, that I hardly dare to mention anything
         else. It is comprised of a breach of promise case, which has been on trial for
         several days, but has now been finished. It has been one of the most interesting
         suits ever dragged into out Kennebec Courts, and the enormous damages which
         were claimed, together with the standing of the parties, drew an immense
         audience throughout the trial. The largest portion of the audience were of the
         crinoline sex, and some of them had hardly got out of pinafores.The principals in this delicate difference of
         opinion are Miss Eleanor Lawrence and Mr. Lorenzo D. Cook. Eleanor is a
         spinster. When I say she is a spinster, I should also say a modest looking and
         by no means bad looking spinster—a spinster who has seen the snows fall and
         the grass grow for thirty-six winters and summers. A spinster who would not be
         so had it not been for the cruel fate which has decreed that others should
         enjoy the delights of the connubial state, while she should linger to an
         uncertain age, ignorant of bliss which she has doubtless dreamed of, but never
         felt. Lorenzo, the gay deceiver, the individual who aroused in Eleanor's breast
         that unquenchable fire, and in her heart burning hopes, is a man thirty-eight
         years of age. He is well to do in this world's good, a knight of the mortar
         and pestle, and has about $50,000 stowed snuggly away, from which his victim
         asked for a slice which to mend her broken heart. Both parties resided in
         Gardiner at the time that poor Eleanor was so ruthlessly deceived. Eleanor Brought the action which has made this
         trial, declaring that this compounder of pills promised to wed her and nobody
         else, which promise he broke and espoused another, for which cruel and
         heartless act nothing short of $10,000 would assuage her grief and make her as
         good as new. Stamps, by the way, to heal a broken heart are often far more
         preferable to a cup of "cold pisen." In the trial, of course Eleanor was the
         important witness. In fact the promise to marry was simply a question of
         veracity between her and the faithless man whom she had so fondly, but not
         wisely loved. It was rich. She told the gushing story of her ardent passion,
         of her interviews with Lorenzo, of his many professions of affection and his
         ardent caresses, which she proved in the authority of Madame Young, a roving
         fortune teller. She told him she could have wedded two others, who are not
         apothecaries, but chose to stick to him; how many Sunday nights they had sat up
         together in sweet converse, and how many toilet articles he had seen fit to
         give her; all these tender little things she told in such a touching manner
         that from the start she won the hearts of the honest jurymen. She swore by her
         hopes of yet being a wife that once upon a time, when they were riding
         together, the faithless Lorenzo promised to wed her within a period of four
         years, which although her heart burned for a speedier consummation, she said
         was satisfactory. What joy thrilled her bosom then! They were engaged, she and
         her darling little son of Esculapeus. True love never runs smoothly, and at
         various times they had their sweet little lovers' quarrels, particularly when
         he danced and flirted with other girls, but those little ruffles were soon
         smoothed down, and no harm took place.Whispers were floating in the air that Lorenzo
         was untrue, and that his love was going from herself to other idols. She could
         not believe herself at first, but finally the fearful truth burst upon her that
         he was engaged to the lady who is now the partner of his joys, and who,
         undoubtedly, does not much love Eleanor. At a public festival this alarming
         truth was disclosed to Eleanor's bewildered brain. She satisfied herself,
         beyond a doubt, that Lorenzo had gone back on her, and then consulted a
         lawyer. Revenge was sweet and stamps were sweeter, and Lorenzo must play or
         pay. Such was the story of her wrongs from her own sweet lips, in her artless and impressive manner. Lorenzo denied the soft
         impeachment. The idea
         of marrying the maiden never entered his head, for he was not in that line of
         business, when he called upon her, and so he told her once when she asked him
         if he intended to lead her to the altar. His conduct toward her was the same
         that it had been towards a score of other female acquaintances, and not a few
         of such beauties he had upon a string, if we may judge by what he said; but
         that he was a suitor, never!A host of witnesses were put upon the stand, and
         several sweet scented notes of chops and tomato-sauce order were introduced,
         purporting to have been written by Lorenzo. His witnesses were browbeaten,
         quizzed, and bullyragged to the crimson blush, and Gen. Shepley, his counsel,
         talked hard to save Lorenzo, but it was no go, and the jury brought in a
         verdict of damages for Eleanor to the tune of $8,000. The amount was something
         of a rib-roaster for interested parties, and made them look aghast. Exceptions
         have been taken, and the case goes up to the Supreme Court.
