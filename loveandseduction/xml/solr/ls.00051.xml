      <field name="text">OPENING OF COURT.When the Court opened Mr. Butterworth handed Mr.
         Carlisle a letter.  Mr. Carlisle and Judge Wilson looked at it curiously, and
         it was passed to Miss Pollard, who glanced at it and passed it to Mrs. Ellis, her companion. Mr.
         Butterworth held a type-written copy in his hand. Mr.
         Carlisle seemed worried, and summoned one of his clerks, to whom he gave some
         instructions. The clerk left the Court room very hastily.
         Miss Pollard then took the stand, and Mrs. Ellis sat next
         her, ready to lend aid if the strength of the witness failed. Mr. Carlisle's preliminary questions were about
         Miss Pollard's parentage. Her father was a saddler; when he died 1886 all the
         Odd Fellows and Masonic lodges in Kentucky sent delegates to Frankfort to attend the funeral. She told of spending some
         time with her Pittsburg aunt after her father's death.In answer
         to Mr. Carlisle, Miss Pollard said: "In the last days of August, in 1892,
         Mr. Breckinridge met me at the Baltimore and Ohio Railway Station."
         "How
         did he greet you?""He
         drew me to him, kissed me, and put me in a carriage and we were driven into the
         country.""What
         did he say in the carriage?""He
         told me that he had something to tell me, and he said he was vain enough to
         think I would be glad to hear it. He said that the children were all grown up
         now, and that there was no reason why he should not marry; he asked me if I
         would marry him, and I told him I would.""Where
         were you stopping during this stay in Washington?""At
         25 Lafayette
         Square.""During
         your few days' stay at this time, was the subject of marriage mentioned?""Yes,
         frequently.""Where
         did you go from Washington?""I
         went to New York, where Mr. Breckinridge joined me. The subject of marriage was
         mentioned during those few days." "Did
         he say anything about when the marriage should take place?""Yes, he said he had waited fourteen
         months after the death of his first wife before taking a second wife, and he
         thought a year would be sufficient to wait for our marriage.""Did
         you agree with him?""No,
         I said that more consideration was due his children; that he should wait at
         least two years.""Was
         there anything said further?""Yes;
         I said that Mrs. Willard, who keeps a young ladies' school in Berlin, was going
         back to Europe with her two daughters, and I thought if I went with them I
         could take a course of study there while the engagement lasted. It
         would only cost a thousand dollars a year, and it would be better that I should
         go there.""Did
         you receive any note from Mrs. Willard about the trip?""Miss
         Willard, who was stopping at Gray Gables, the summer home of President
         Cleveland, at Buzzard's Bay, wrote me that 
         she hoped I would go with
         them."
         This
         note was produced and read by Mr. Carlisle.Miss
         Pollard was also questioned concerning her residence at 25 Lafayette Square, where she said Mr. Breckinridge called on her
         frequently, and said many times that a year after his wife's death was
         sufficient to wait. "I saw him always once a day, sometimes twice a day, and during the evening," she said. Miss
         Pollard said she had communicated the fact of her engagement to Mrs. Thomas,
         who lived at 25 Lafayette Square, and also to Claude de la Roche Francis.  She
         told of the
         conversation with Colonel Breckinridge, which Mr. Francis said he overheard, in
         which Colonel Breckinridge said he was sorry she had told Mr. Francis of their
         engagement. Miss Pollard also told the story of her presentation to Mrs. Luke
         Blackburn by Colonel Breckinridge as his future wife, and of his placing her in
         Mrs. Blackburn's charge as "my future wife," as testified to by Mrs.
         Blackburn a few days ago.
         Miss
         Pollard went on to tell of the time when she and the defendant went again to
         see Mrs. Blackburn, and Miss Pollard asked Colonel Breckinridge to tell Mrs.
         Blackburn when he intended to marry her. "I knelt down beside his
         chair," she said, "and asked him that, and Mrs. Blackburn, I think,
         objected to this display of affection."
         Miss Pollard was asked
         concerning her visits to Dr. N. S. Lincoln and to Major Moore, the
         superintendent of police, with Colonel Breckinridge, on which occasions, according to
         the testimony of Dr. Lincoln and Major Moore, Colonel Breckinridge acknowledged
         his engagement to her.
         "In 1884," said Miss Pollard, "I
         was summoned from school in Cincinnati to go to Frankfort, where my sister was
         very ill.  Mr. Rodes put me on the car. A gentleman was in the car and coming
         over to me he said: 'Your face is familiar; don't I know you?' I said:
         'No, but I know who you are. You are
         Colonel Breckinridge.' He sat down on the other side of the aisle and asked me
         if he might come to see me. I said my aunt and my mother would be very glad to
         see him at Frankfort. That was all that was said."Questions
         by Mr. Carlisle brought out the history of Miss Pollard's engagement to James
         C. Rodes. She had met him and he asked her to marry him. She said she did not
         want to marry then; she wanted to get an education first. He said if she would
         marry him he would pay for her education. Miss Pollard did not answer that she
         would marry him, but "I told him that if he would pay for my education I
         would either marry him or pay him back with interest.   He agreed,
         and a paper containing the agreement was drawn up and signed in the presence of
         my mother."Miss Pollard said she did not keep the letters
         written her by Rodes; she always destroyed his letters.Colonel Breckinridge and Mr. Stoll exchanged
         knowing smiles at this answer."In one of these letters Mr. Rodes said he could compel me
         to marry him or pay him back. I could not pay him back, and I did not want to
         marry him. I did not know a man, woman, or a child to whom I could turn for
         advice until I thought — until I thought of — Mr. Breckinridge.   I wrote him
         asking if Mr. Rodes could compel me to marry him. He answered that letter in person,
         coming to see me at Wesleyan College, in Cincinnati, where I was a pupil. I saw him in the drawing-room
         of the college, and he said that was not the place to have a confidential
         conversation. He asked couldn't we get up some sort of a relationship so that
         I could get permission to go out. I told him it was not necessary to be
         related, and we could get permission. He said, looking at a paper in his hand,
         that there was a concert that evening, and we could go there. He obtained
         permission to take me out from young 
         Mr. Brown, the principal's son." 
         "That evening Mr. Breckinridge came back in
         a closed carriage to take me out. It was a warm, sultry June evening, and I
         objected to going in a closed carriage, but he said he had a throat affection,
         so we went out.""When
         did you see him again?""The
         next morning at the public library, by appointment. He said he wanted to take
         me to Lexington. We went to Lexington Friday.""Where did you go after reaching Lexington?""To Sarah Gess's.""What time was
         it that you arrived in Lexington?" "About dusk.""How long did you stay there?" "Until Monday morning.""Who
         was with you at Sarah Gess's from Friday night until Monday morning?""Mr. Breckinridge was there most of the
         time.""What did Colonel Breckinridge say to you
         on the evening of your arrival in Lexington about Mr. Rodes?""Nothing.""What
         did he say about Mr. Rodes on the following Monday morning?""Mr. Breckinridge
         came to Sarah Gess's terribly frightened. He said that Mr. Rodes had been to Cincinnati
         and found out that I had gone with him, and that I must catch a train and go to
         Frankfort, where my mother lived, which I did.""Who
         suggested that you leave Cincinnati and go to Sayre Institute?" "Mr. Breckinridge."Miss Pollard told of going to see a female
         physician, Dr. Mary Street, in Cincinnati, in 1885, at the direction of Mr.
         Breckinridge, to make arrangements for the birth of her first child. She gave
         Dr. Street the name of Mrs. Burgoyne. She took lodgings over a mattress factory,
         and stayed about a month; then, after moving further up the street and remaining
         there for awhile, she went to St. Joseph's Asylum at Norwood, where she registered
         as "Mrs. Burgwynn." Her baby was born on May 29, 1885, and two
         weeks later she went to the house of Drs. Perry and Buchanan to recuperate.
         Miss Pollard identified the four volumes of Washington Irving that have figured
         in the trial. They were given her by Mr. Rodes at Christmas, 1884, and she gave
         them to Sister Cecilia at the foundling asylum.Miss Pollard had given her testimony without any
         noticeable marks of nervousness, except in a rising tendency of her voice at
         times, and an inclination to talk too fast. She looked Col. Breckinridge
         squarely in the eyes while giving her testimony without appearing to do so.Taking up her life at Lexington after the birth
         of her baby, Mr. Carlisle asked Miss Pollard who paid for her tuition and board
         while she was at Sayre Institute."Mr.
         Breckinridge, of course," was the reply."Miss
         Pollard," was the next question, "who was the father of the child
         born on the 29th of May, 1885?""Mr.
         Breckinridge," was the answer, long drawn out for the sake of emphasis."Miss Pollard, did you
         ever at any time or place, prior to meeting Col. Breckinridge, have any sexual
         relations with any man?""No;
         never; never.""Miss
         Pollard, have you at any time or place, after meeting Col. Breckinridge, had
         sexual relations with any other man?" "No;
         never; never.""Were you ever at the house of Sarah Gess
         with any other person than Colonel Breckinridge?""Why, certainly not," said Miss
         Pollard, with an inflection of surprise.Miss Pollard said she came to Washington from Lexington in September, 1887, at Mr.
         Breckinridge's desire. "I had to go
         somewhere," she said. Mr. Breckinridge took her to the boarding-house here
         that is now the Elsmere, and then, after a few days, to a boarding-house at
         Thirteenth and F streets, where she was known as Mrs. Charles Foster. Mr.
         Breckinridge stayed there also, but they went away when it became known that
         "Mr. Sam Walter," a boarder at the house, was no other than Colonel Breckinridge. Then Miss
         Pollard went to St. Ann's Foundling Asylum in Washington, where she used to go
         out every night to meet Mr. Breckinridge until the Sister in charge objected,
         when Colonel Breckinridge took her away, saying if he couldn't meet her she
         couldn't stay here. He took her to a little house in South Washington occupied by an
         old woman called "Aunt Mary," and she remained there until her second
         baby was born, in February, 1888. After her
         confinement she went to live at a convent on Massachusetts avenue, and remained there for two years and six months. During
         part of this time she was employed in the
         government service, the rest in studying. She saw the defendant three or four
         times each week during that period.
         After leaving the convent she went to live at Mrs. Fillette's, corner of
         Thirteenth and L streets; then to No. 1 B street, Northwest; then to Jefferson Place. Miss Pollard told of other frequent
         changes in residence while she resided in Washington.Mr. Carlisle produced the little wicker
         sewing-work basket, which the late Mrs. Breckinridge had given her sister, Miss
         Desha, and asked Miss Pollard if she knew it. "Yes," she said. "He
         brought it to me just after his wife died, saying, 'Madeline, she cared for this, and won't you have it?' I
         appreciated it very much," with a doleful little voice."Now,
         Miss Pollard,"
         said Mr. Carlisle, "what was your condition in May, 1893?""I—I wasn't well"—falteringly. "What was the matter with you?" "I—I
         was—was pregnant again." "By Colonel Breckinridge?""Why,
         of course," this with a sad voice. "What
         was the result of that pregnancy?" "A
         miscarriage.""When did it occur?" "On May 24th, I believe." "Where?""At 1819 H Street." "Who attended you?" "Dr. Tabor Johnson."Such
         a case is not complete without the conventional packages of love letters, and
         they were produced next for Miss Pollard's examination. "Those are
         all Mr. Breckinridge's letters," she said. She was also shown twelve
         telegrams, addressed to her. "Yes, all Mr. Breckinridge's
         telegrams," was her comment. In
         answer to Mr. Carlisle, Miss Pollard said Colonel Breckinridge last left Washington
         on Wednesday night, May 17, 1893, Then Mr. Carlisle read telegrams and letters
         from Colonel Breckinridge to Miss Pollard, written while he was away on this
         trip from Lexington, Covington, and other places. Nearly every day he
         telegraphed her asking if she were well, telling her to make herself comfortable,
         and to occupy herself. The letters were not at all of the amorous kind; they
         were friendly, but not too much so. They were signed "Yours," or
         "Yours truly and sincerely," and had no heading. Some of the letters were read at the
         trial the other day. They referred to some sanitarium which Miss Pollard had
         mentioned, and advised her not to go there; she was better where she was at
         1819 H Street. This period included the time when Miss Pollard suffered a
         miscarriage. Colonel Breckinridge, Miss Pollard said, was delivering political
         speeches in Kentucky and Tennessee.The
         next question came near bringing on a scene."Miss
         Pollard," said Mr. Carlisle, "what were the conversations you had
         with Colonel Breckinridge about going to a sanitarium?""Oh, Mr. Carlisle, I hardly know how to say these
         things before so many men!" said Miss Pollard, plaintively, in a rather
         high voice. "I can't say them." There was a suspicion of tears in
         Miss Pollard's eyes."Never mind — don't say anything — don't
         answer," said Judge Wilson.Other
         letters from Colonel Breckinridge on the subject of Miss Pollard's health, and telling
         that he was going to Missouri, Pennsylvania, and other places. Colonel
         Breckinridge made reference to sending some papers, and Miss Pollard explained
         that "some papers" meant money — they did not like to refer to money
         in their letters.Mr.
         Carlisle read, impressively, a letter from Lexington to Miss Pollard, in which
         Colonel Breckinridge said: 'I can not go to Charlottesville, nor can you go to Washington. It will result in an
         open scandal. As matters now are, your character and reputation are safe. You
         owe it to yourself to remain away. It is due to you to write that I will
         consider your coming to Lexington as conclusive, and you must then take the responsibility
         of all that might ensue. You ought to control yourself and make yourself
         comfortable — restore your health, and not destroy yourself.                             Do
         not make it impossible for me to do what is best.'  Yours, WILLIAM
         C. P. Breckinridge.Some of these letters and telegrams were
         addressed to Miss Pollard at "The Farms," near Charlottesville, Virginia. A copy of a letter to Miss Pollard from Colonel
         Breckinridge, referring to the
         publication of the report that they were engaged, was produced and identified
         by Miss Pollard; but, before it was read, the recess hour (12:30) arrived, and
         a recess was ordered until 1:15 o'clock.After
         recess a letter was read from Miss Pollard to Colonel Breckinridge acknowledging
         that she had published the announcement of their engagement and that she was sorry
         for it. This was evidently in answer to a letter from Colonel Breckinridge,
         taking her to task for the publication.This letter began, "My Dear Willie," and
         was signed, "Your Loving Madeline." Miss Pollard resumed the stand as
         the Court was rapped to order, with Mrs. Ellis sitting by her side; she was
         directly in front of and about fifteen feet from Colonel Breckinridge. During
         the morning session, while Miss Pollard was giving her testimony, the defendant
         sat in a listless attitude, but not taking his eyes off his accuser.  But in the afternoon he took an active interest in the
         proceedings, and made
         suggestions to his counsel. Miss Pollard identified several letters and
         telegrams, exchanged between Colonel Breckinridge and herself.   One from Miss
         Pollard inclosed "a very ugly paragraph," as Miss Pollard called it,
         that appeared in the Lexington Gazette, saying that Colonel Breckinridge had
         said to a friend that there was no truth in the published report of his
         engagement to Miss Pollard. In this letter, which began formally, "Colonel
         Breckinridge" Miss Pollard called attention to the paragraph, and demanded
         that he make immediate acknowledgment of the engagement, not through the
         newspapers, but in a written statement of the facts, addressed to her, and
         signed with his own name. She told him if he did not do this, she would take
         means to obtain justice. This letter was sent registered to make sure of its
         delivery.  No answer was returned, Miss Pollard said. Miss Pollard went
         on identifying letters and other papers, after acknowledging that she was
         responsible for the publication of the announcement of her engagement in the
         papers. A letter dated April 23, 1889, was identified by Miss Pollard
         as a blind letter, one of several that it had been necessary to write to conceal the relations of Colonel
         Breckinridge and herself while Mrs. Breckinridge was living. She had gone with
         Colonel Breckinridge to hear him lecture on religious and quasi religious
         subjects, said the witness. Reverting to the conversation of the plaintiff
         and defendant in the office of the Chief of Police here, in which, according to
         the Chief's testimony, Colonel Breckinridge had promised to marry Miss Pollard, the
         witness said that on that occasion Colonel Breckinridge named May 31 following
         (1893) as the date. Later Colonel Breckinridge had changed this date on account
         of the nearness of the expected birth of her baby to that time, but he said if
         she would be happier he would marry her on the date named.
         The last question asked by Mr. Carlisle was as
         to how long the illicit relationship existed between Colonel Breckinridge and the plaintiff, and Miss Pollard
         answered loudly and distinctly, emphasizing every syllable: "From that
         night when he took me to Sarah Gess's in 1884, there never was any suggestion
         of the discontinuance of that miserable sin until Colonel Breckinridge, with
         all his protestations and promises and vows of affection left me on the 17th
         day of May, 1893," Major Butterworth tried to stop Miss Pollard, telling
         her to simply answer the question but
         he was plucked by the sleeve by Colonel Breckinridge and Colonel Thompson, and
         desisted. But he could not have stopped Miss Pollard; she went right on.This
         concluded the direct examination, and Major Butterworth began the
         cross-examination.Major Butterworth began by an examination into
         Miss Pollard's age; and she told him, as she had told Mr. Carlisle, that she
         had believed, until this suit was filed, that she was born in 1864; but when
         the question of her age was raised, she remembered something that her mother
         and her sister told her in 1876. When her father died she had supposed, in
         1876, that she was twelve years old at that time; but her mother and her sister
         told her that she was born November 30th, 1866; so she was ten instead of
         twelve in 1876. Miss Pollard became excited over some pertinent questions about
         her early life, which she said she could not answer, because she could not
         remember. Her father was not a scholarly man she said to Major
         Butterworth, but he was a well-read man. He taught her what he could. He took
         perfect delight in teaching his little "gyrul," who was not so high
         as the table. Mr. Butterworth persisted in saying that Miss Pollard was twelve
         when her father died, and Miss Pollard became annoyed. She had said she was
         ten then.  "I wish you wouldn't repeat that, Mr. Butterworth," she
         said; "it's very annoying." Her father had told her fairy stories;
         he had read her Shakspeare, history, and pretty little poems. She was fond  of
         all these things."What else did he
         teach you?" asked Mr. Butterworth. "Why, Mr. Butterworth, what would
         you teach your little girl?" was the answer, and there was a laugh. "How
         were you employed while living at Crab Orchard, Kentucky, with your parents?" 
         "What was I doing from the time I was born until I was four years old?
         Why, Mr. Butterworth, I did more playing than any little girl you ever
         met." "You say your father taught you history," said Mr.
         Butterworth. "Did he teach you much history?" "Not so much as Colonel
         Breckinridge told me afterward," was the answer; and it took the crier
         nearly a minute to stop the laughter. Miss Pollard became more annoyed as
         Major Butterworth asked her minutely as to her studies, what she had read, what
         she knew, and how she studied."Now I told you that twice, Mr.
         Butterworth," and she ran on rapidly, telling how, whenever she heard
         anything that Major Butterworth or some other statesman had said, she got
         Colonel Breckinridge to get her books from the Congressional Library to look it
         up.""Did
         you read Browning?" was asked "Oh,
         no; I was never that deep." "Did
         you read Burns?""Oh, you know I did not; only some
         selections — Cotter's Saturday Night, and all that""Byron?""I
         never read Byron to this day."Miss
         Pollard's answers were bright and sometimes witty, and kept pace with the
         keen-minded Major Butterworth. Miss Pollard sketched her life at Crab Orchard,
         how she had left it to go to her aunt's at Pittsburg, where she remained until
         August, 1880, when she returned to her mother's in Frankfort.What she did and how she did it at Frankfort, who she knew there,
         what pleasures she had — all these things Mr. Butterworth
         wanted to know. Miss Pollard said she did what every country girl did at home
         —sweep and dusted and such things. "I was only a country girl," she
         added, with the peculiar Southern twist in the last word.  She knew
         absolutely nobody in the neighborhood; she had not even a bowing acquaintance
         with anybody nearby.It
         was while at Frankfort that James C. Rodes asked her to marry him, after having seen her
         three or four times, and Miss Pollard told of the bargain through which her
         education was obtained. He had asked her before her aunt and several others."Mr.
         Rodes," she said, "was not a conventional man." This caused a
         laugh."Was
         this your first offer of marriage?""No,
         I had one the year before from a Mr. Woods, but I had no more to do with that
         than you had, Mr. Butterworth." Colonel Breckinridge joined in the laughter
         over this sally."Where
         is the paper you wrote Mr. Rodes telling him you would marry him if he would
         pay for your education?""I
         don't know; perhaps Mr. Breckinridge has it.""If
         Mr. Breckinridge has the paper, he should produce it," said Judge Wilson."He's not Rodes' executor," said Colonel
         Thompson. The demand of Judge Wilson was not pressed.Miss Pollard admitted she was engaged to Mr. Rozell
         while she was at the Wesleyan College, in Cincinnati, during the continuance of
         her contract with Mr. Rodes. Mr. Butterworth spoke of her contract with Rodes
         as "the engagement," and Miss Pollard objected to its being put that
         way. Mr. Rodes had loaned her the money to get her education on the condition
         that she should pay him back or marry him."Did
         you tell of this engagement to Rodes?" "No,
         sir.""Did you break off with Rozell?""Yes, while Mr. Breckinridge was concealed
         in a sitting room adjoining and heard me break my engagement with Rozell. I was
         pregnant at the time by Mr. Breckinridge."There
         was one sally that created a roar. Mr. Butterworth asked Miss Pollard
         if Colonel Breckinridge had recognized her on the train at their first meeting,
         and Miss Pollard said: "He crossed the aisle and asked me if he did not
         recognize me and, by the way, that is a common trick of his, recognizing people
         he doesn't know." Miss Pollard in answer to other questions said, she
         had seen many things in Mr. Breckinridge during their nine years' association
         that she did not like, including this trick of recognition, but she had not
         found him out then. Mr. Butterworth tried to make the witness say that on the
         first night Colonel Breckinridge came to see her he had brought a carriage at
         her suggestion, but Miss Pollard met him with: "Now, Mr. Butterworth, you
         know I never said anything of the kind."  Some more questions were
         met with earnest answers that made the spectators laugh, and then at 3:15
         o'clock the Court adjourned until Monday.
