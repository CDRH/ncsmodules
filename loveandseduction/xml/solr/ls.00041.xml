      <field name="text">Tennyson's....'The Palace of
         Art', relates how an individual 'soul' selfishly withdraws from the
         responsibilities of life in the manner of Huysmans's Des Esseintes. The poet
         constructs a series of chambers, each of which represents a state of mind or
         thought, and the reader is led through them until, finally, he perceives that a
         Palace of Art will not suffice: succumbing to the pains of isolation,
         Tennyson's allegorical protagonist suffers what is essentially a nervous
         breakdown, and this psychological trauma precipitates her realization that she
         must leave the confines of this enclosing artifice and live a humbler life—until such time as she can lead others back to
         join her in the pleasures of
         art. Tennyson's poem, is particularly interesting to compare to 
         The
         Awakening Conscience, 
         because although he cast his poem in the
         form of an allegory, he chose to detail the psychological causes and mechanism
         of the soul's conversion. We have no external evidence that Hunt drew upon 'The
         Palace of Art', but F. G. Stephens quotes the following lines from the poem when
         trying to convey the experience of the woman in 
         The
         Awakening Conscience:
         ...in dark corners of her palace stood Uncertain shapes; and unawaresOn white-eyed phantasms weeping tears of blood, And horrible
         night-mares,And hollow shades enclosing hearts of flame, And, with dim fretted foreheads all,On corpses three-months-old at
         noon she came, That stood against the wall.These horrific lines, one
         should point out, only convey the soul's recognition of sin and isolation, and they
         do not fully represent Tennyson's method of portraying spiritual illumination.
         Since we have no evidence from the painter himself that he consciously drew
         upon this poem, we can conclude only that he might have had it in mind.
         Stephens nonetheless helpfully reminds us that when Hunt came to paint a
         realistic companion piece to 
         The Light of the World, 
         he,
         like Tennyson, emphasized the psychological experience of illumination.But whatever the painting's complex origins in Dickens,
         Tennyson, and
         Hunt's own readings in the Bible, its subject, tone, and method remain largely
         Hogarthian. The degree to which he had his eighteenth-century predecessor in
         mind when considering such subjects appears with clarity in his 
         Reader
         
         essay on Augustus Egg. He devotes particular attention to
         Egg's tripartite work now known as 
         Past and Present,
         which Hunt insists should be called 
         The Adulteress, 
         and
         in defending his friend's work he frequently sounds as if he were defending 
         The
         Awakening Conscience 
         as well. Pointing out that 'it is the fashion ... to
         denounce all morals that are severe, particularly on this subject', Hunt claims
         that Egg nonetheless 'determined to make a sacrifice of popularity for the
         principle that he felt it might illustrate'. Hunt's only regret was that Egg
         had not in the manner of Hogarth made a longer, and hence clearer narrative
         series. Because 'it is by no means a matter of course that when a woman sins
         she should die in misery,' he would like the audience to perceive the mechanism
         of her fall depicted more fully. 'Hogarth left no gap in his histories. Egg
         leaves us to wonder whether the erring wife was more overcome by her conscience
         ... or was more imprudent than those who in daily life gather honours and
         worship by their wickedness.' He concludes that whatever the shortcomings of
         Egg's paintings, they were 'free from the false sentimentality' of many novels
         which dwell upon such vice with prurient delight. Now that the story of Hunt's
         relationship with Annie Miller is known, it seems quite possible that he was
         casting a sideways glance at the woman he once wanted to marry—
         and who
         apparently had profited from her 'wickedness'. Perhaps more important to our
         understanding of 
         The Awakening Conscience 
         (for
         which, incidentally, Annie had originally modelled) is the likelihood that Hunt
         believed it a better, more Hogarthian manner of approaching this kind of moral
         subject. For although he was not engaged to paint a series detailing the
         harlot's progress, he concentrated upon the crucial moment in the woman's
         history. Unlike the fifth plate of Hogarth's 
         Marriage á 
         la Mode, The Awakening Conscience 
         
         does not require a murder for the woman to achieve
         self-recognition, but, like the earlier work, it is the lover who
         unintentionally brings about this change in her. Furthermore, Hunt's
         willingness to dwell upon the seducer, whom Stephens described as 'a showy, handsome
         tiger of the human species', may also be seen as another
         Hogarthian point he found lacking in Egg. While writing about Egg's two
         paintings on the life and death of Buckingham, he pointed out that 'admirable'
         as the pictures were, they suffer from the fact that 'the mind of the painter
         was too fastidious—too respectable to do justice to the depravity of the
         orgie—it would have required a Hogarth to do this.' The result, argues Hunt,
         was that rather than creating an image of vice, Egg has presented us with 'a
         company of merry people, well dressed, well conducted, and, for all one could
         see, as virtuous as any of us who eat cakes and ale.' Although Hunt
         himself was not interested in duplicating the orgies of the third and sixth
         plates of 
         
         The Rake's Progress, 
         
         he did follow Hogarth in his attempt to depict the
         vices of his seducer.The
         strong anti-aristocratic bias of 
         The Awakening Conscience is also
         Hogarthian, and it is here that we can observe one of the strongest influences
         of 
         The Rake's 
         and 
         Harlot's
         Progresses 
         upon Hunt. According to Stephens, the painting represents
         'the interior of one of those 
         maisons damnées 
         which
         the wealth of the seducer has furnished for the luxury of a woman who has sold
         herself and her soul to him,' and he emphasizes that 'one of his patrician arms
         surrounds the victim of his passions.' Stephens
         places enough importance on the
         political implications of 
         
         The
         Awakening Conscience 
         
         that it seems
         reasonable to assume he is directly echoing Hunt's ideas: it is the 'wealth' of
         a 'patrician' which makes the woman a 'victim'.
         Far more central to Hunt's symbolism than these similar
         attitudes towards art and morality is the fact that he employs an entire range
         of Hogarthian devices to convey meaning. Like Hogarth, he relies upon inscriptions,
         scriptural texts, and other incorporations of language within and without the
         design. When 
         The Awakening Conscience 
         was
         first exhibited at the 1854 Royal Academy, Hunt accompanied it in the catalogue
         with two scriptural texts. The first, from the Apocryphal Ecclesiasticus 14:18,
         can be taken to mean that human beings, like all living things, have differing
         fates, and can live or die spiritually as well as physically: 'As of the green
         leaves on a thick tree, some fall and some grow; so is the generation of flesh
         and blood .' The first gloss thus prepares the spectator for the
         painting's subject, a turning point in the woman's spiritual life. The second,
         which Hunt took from Isaiah, bears more directly upon the woman's confrontation
         with herself and Christ: 'Strengthen ye the feeble hands, and confirm ye the
         tottering knees; say ye to the faint hearted: Be ye strong; fear ye not; behold
         your God.' Addressing both the woman in the painting and the spectator, Hunt
         simultaneously offers her courage and requests the sympathy of his audience for
         her—and for those like her whom the spectator might encounter in real life.
         On the frame Hunt placed a motto from Proverbs which functions rather
         differently: 'As he who taketh away a garment in cold weather, so is he who
         singeth songs unto a heavy heart. These words comment not upon the woman, but
         upon her unfeeling seducer, who remains unaware how his words have oppressed
         her conscience and yet done her good. Furthermore, as Stephens reminds us, the
         emblems placed upon the frame also serve to prepare the spectator for what lies
         within its bounds. The ringing bells and marigolds are, respectively, 'the
         emblems of warning and sorrow'—emblems which, again, apply to both the woman
         represented and the spectator alike—while at the top of the frame 'is set a
         star,' which we may assume stands for Christ or truth.Furthermore, in his attempt to make all the details of
         this picture assist in conveying his tale of great spiritual change, Hunt,
         again following Hogarth, has included paintings which echo or comment upon the
         main theme. As Stephens points out, 'The very decorations on the wall are
         significant, and might have suggested repentance before. They bear a vineyard,
         in which corn is mingled with the vine; birds destroy the grapes of the latter,
         while at the foot sleeps a boy-guardian, whose horn, fallen from his hand,
         indicates neglected duty.' In addition to this tapestry, which obviously
         echoes 
         The Hireling Shepherd, 
         Hunt also included a
         painting over the fire-place which, as Ruskin points out, depicts a 'single
         drooping figure—the woman taken in adultery.' In making use of these
         Hogarthian touches, Hunt, one may note, has slightly sacrificed his realistic
         intention to reinforce his meaning: it is unlikely, certainly, for the kept
         woman to have hung such a painting above her mantel or to have taken much
         solace in it—unless it were from the fact that Christ forgives all and warns
         none of us to cast the first stone. Such an ingenious explanation, however,
         seems beyond the capacity of Hunt's intended heroine, and the picture on the
         mantel has an element of obvious artificiality which Hunt does not later
         employ.Unlike
         the picture and the tapestry, the cat which, unnoticed by either figure, is
         toying with a helpless bird, functions in a more natural, if no less Hogarthian
         manner. As Stephens suggests, the image of the 'false, pitiless, and cruel' seducer
         is the cat, 'which, having brought a living bird into the room, grants short
         respite to it, because the singing has disturbed her purpose of destruction.'
         This rather blatant symbol of the man also serves to suggest how harsh will be
         the young woman's fate, how painful her return to virtue. [John Duncan]Macmillan has
         proposed that Hunt drew upon Hogarth's 
         The Lady's Last Stake 
         for 
         The
         Awakening Conscience, but Durer's engraving of the 
         Young
         Woman Attacked by Death (The Ravisher)
         is an even
         more likely source: not only is the disposition of the two figures much closer,
         but the main theme of 
         The Awakening Conscience 
         appears
         in Durer's engraving, for in Hunt's view the seducer is an embodiment of death
         from whose arms she must struggle to reach Christ and new life.Finally,
         as both Ruskin and Stephens point out, the room's gaudy, vulgar furnishings
         serve not only to indicate the woman's present position in society but also the
         moral and aesthetic values of both seducer and seduced. When this young woman
         flees her enclosing room, she will be leaving not a Palace of Art but one of vulgarity. We perceive how false have been the
         values by which she has lived
         until now. Looking at this room from the perspective of aesthetic and political
         statements Hunt made elsewhere, we perceive an indictment of the upper classes
         who have used their wealth to create precisely this kind of heartless surroundings
         for their victims. Thus, like Ruskin's 
         Stones of Venice 
         and 'Traffic', 
         The Awakening Conscience 
         claims
         that taste speaks to the entire human being, and that therefore the moral
         nature of a man, class, and society appear in the arts they choose. Hunt, who
         frequently accused the rich of encouraging only the worst in art and general
         taste, concluded his memoir with the affirmation that 'the purpose of art is,
         in love of guileless beauty, to lead man to distinguish between that which,
         being clean in spirit, is productive of virtue, and that which is flaunting and
         meretricious and productive of ruin
         to a Nation.' Here in this early work he is using, not love of beauty,
         but the satirist's devices to enable his audience to discern what is clean in
         spirit.I
         would therefore argue that Macmillan is incorrect in denying that Hunt was ever
         a satirist. According to him, the chief importance of Hogarth to Hunt was in
         the use of modern moral subjects, and the Pre-Raphaelite never shared his
         predecessor's satiric emphasis:The
         difference between Hunt and Hogarth is that the former sought to be effective
         not through satire and through irony, but through exhortation and demonstration
         of what seemed to him the fundamental truths. Unlike Hogarth's works, his
         pictures are not aimed at particular aspects of social behavior, but instead
         make general moral propositions. This is why the 
         Awakening
         Conscience...is as much a metaphor of a universal spiritual risk as a
         particular tract for the redemption of fallen women. It is more a religious
         picture than a piece of social commentary.No
         one would deny that 
         The Awakening Conscience is more
         a religious painting than one concerned primarily with social commentary,
         satiric or otherwise; but for Hunt the two intentions are not necessarily
         opposed. Certainly, the powerful satiric analogies present in 
         The
         Hireling Shepherd 
         and 
         Our English Coasts 
         show
         Hunt making use of irony, while the more detailed satire of 
         The
         Awakening Conscience 
         serves both political and social commentary. True, in each
         picture satire is only part of Hunt's complex intention, and in that part
         he turned to Hogarth for instruction. Hunt's friends also saw him as
         occasionally playing the role of the satirist. While he was at work on 
         The
         Shadow of Death 
         his friend Tupper wrote describing some 'palpable
         Pecksniff,' and urged him: 'Come here quickly and paint some pictures in the
         modern vein like "The Awakening Conscience" —something—anything by
         way of a looking glass for these times.' But once Hunt found his major
         interest in scriptural subjects, he did not take time to hold the satirist's
         mirror up to his society, and when he did paint another work with satiric
         elements its subject was taken from the Middle East.
