      <field name="text">scene one: Beach scene that leads to regretHere about the beach I wander'd,
         nourishing a youth sublime With the fairy tales of science,
         and the long result of Time; When the centuries behind me like
         a fruitful land reposed; When I clung to all the present
         for the promise that it closed: When I dipt into the future far as
         human eye could see; Saw the Vision of the world and
         all the wonder that would be.— In the Spring a fuller crimson
         comes upon the robin's breast; In the Spring the wanton lapwing
         gets himself another crest; In the Spring a livelier iris
         changes on the burnish'd dove; In the Spring a young man's fancy
         lightly turns to thoughts of love. Then her cheek was pale and
         thinner than should be for one so young, And her eyes on all my motions
         with a mute observance hung. And I said, "My cousin Amy,
         speak, and speak the truth to me, Trust me, cousin, all the current
         of my being sets to thee." On her pallid cheek and forehead
         came a colour and a light, As I have seen the rosy red
         flushing in the northern night. And she turn'd her bosom shaken
         with a sudden storm of sighs — All the spirit deeply dawning in
         the dark of hazel eyes — Saying, "I have hid my
         feelings, fearing they should do me wrong"; Saying, "Dost thou love me,
         cousin?" weeping, "I have loved thee long." Love took up the glass of Time,
         and turn'd it in his glowing hands; Every moment, lightly shaken, ran
         itself in golden sands. Love took up the harp of Life, and
         smote on all the chords with might; Smote the chord of Self, that,
         trembling, pass'd in music out of sight. Many a morning on the moorland did
         we hear the copses ring, And her whisper throng'd my pulses
         with the fullness of the Spring. Many an evening by the waters did
         we watch the stately ships, And our spirits rush'd together at
         the touching of the lips. O my cousin, shallow-hearted! O my
         Amy, mine no more! O the dreary, dreary moorland! O
         the barren, barren shore! Falser than all fancy fathoms,
         falser than all songs have sung, Puppet to a father's threat, and
         servile to a shrewish tongue! Is it well to wish thee
         happy? — having known me —to decline On a range of lower feelings and a
         narrower heart than mine! Yet it shall be; thou shalt lower
         to his level day by day, What is fine within thee growing
         coarse to sympathize with clay. As the husband is, the wife is:
         thou art mated with a clown, And the grossness of his nature
         will have weight to drag thee down. He will hold thee, when his
         passion shall have spent its novel force, Something better than his dog, a
         little dearer than his horse. What is this? his eyes are heavy;
         think not they are glazed with wine. Go to him, it is thy duty, kiss
         him, take his hand in thine. It may be my lord is weary, that
         his brain is overwrought: Soothe him with thy finer fancies,
         touch him with thy lighter thought. He will answer to the purpose,
         easy things to understand — Better thou wert dead before me,
         tho' I slew thee with my hand! Better thou and I were lying,
         hidden from the heart's disgrace, Roll'd in one another's arms, and
         silent in a last embrace. Cursed be the social wants that
         sin against the strength of youth! Cursed be the social lies that
         warp us from the living truth! Cursed be the sickly forms that
         err from honest Nature's rule! Cursed be the gold that gilds the
         straiten'd forehead of the fool!
