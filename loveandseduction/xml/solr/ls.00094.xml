      <field name="text">1. "As 'guardians' of the virtuous, the Female Moral Reform Society members were determined to make life miserable for those
         men—and women—who deliberately chose (or remained in) a licentious course.  Attacking the double standard just as McDowall
         had done, the women demanded social ostracism of immoral males and females.  They admonished virtuous women to shun the company
         of known (or even suspected) seducers and to exclude them from the family circle.  Virtuous men were advised not only to keep
         seducers away from their families, but to avoid contact with them in all public places, even in their businesses.  Despite
         these admonitions, the moral purifiers knew that seduction still occurred.  Also, they perceived that the females involved
         still bore the largest share of the shame and punishment imposed by the community.  To make the licentious male suffer as
         much as the licentious female—to end the double standard—the Female Moral Reform Society in the late 1830s began to petition
         the state legilature for laws to punish seducers. . . . [By 1841,] opposition to the proposal continuted to thwart the law's
         passage.  The responses made to the requests to sign the petitions were essentially the arguments made against the bill. 
         Female moral reformers were told that women should have 'nothing to do with the subject [licentiousness].'  A concern about
         seduction was 'out of their sphere' and 'unlady-like.'   The most common reasons for opposing the anti-seduction law were
         that nothing could be done to end sexual immorality, that 'it was a necessary evil,' and that even if laws against seduction
         were enacted, they would be impossible to enforce.
         The argument that anti-vice laws could not be
         enforced was based on the contention that people cannot be made moral by
         legislation. The same belief had motivated much of the opposition to other
         reforms designed to improve morals. Anti-temperance people argued that
         prohibition laws had many inconsistencies, divided communities, created more
         lawbreakers than they prevented, and turned people into spies against their
         neighbors. Like some prohibition advocates the moral purifiers replied that
         although legislation could not produce a morally-pure society by itself, when
         combined with other reform measures legislation could help to achieve such a
         morally-pure state. The moral purifiers argued that at least legislation could
         make the people who broke the laws wish that they had been more moral.During the 1840s, city newspapers gave
         increasing support to the anti-seduction law campaign. To some degree, the
         endorsements proffered by newspapers which once had attacked the moral
         reformers indicate that the reformers had had success in changing attitudes
         toward seduction. The newspapers' support put additional pressure on the
         legislature to pass the law. More pressure arose in 1845 when female reformers
         in Massachusetts persuaded the legislature to pass a law against abducting
         women for sexual purposes. In 1848, New York lawmakers made seduction a 'crime
         against society'. Those men convicted of seducing 'an unmarried female of
         previous chaste character' faced imprisonment for a maximum of five years and a
         fine of not more than a thousand dollars. The testimony of the seduced female,
         however, had to be supported by 'other evidence.'One would expect that with the law secured the
         moral purifiers would have immediately filled the court dockets with seduction
         cases. This did not happen for several reasons. First, as some critics had
         predicted, the law was difficult to enforce. Seduced women were often
         reluctant to press charges against their seducers. Moral reformers and their
         critics did agree on one thing—that it was shameful and humiliating for a
         woman to admit her loss of chastity. Furthermore, the admission in court of
         loss of chastity by a woman would have exposed her to family and community
         censure. Such a possibility no doubt kept many women out of the courts. Also,
         there was a fallacious assumption in the attitude toward seduction: that
         seduction involved a villain and a victim. Unless rape was involved, all cases
         of seduction consisted of 'two parties consenting.' The 'seduced woman' in
         other words, was not a victim. 'It argues but a mean opinion of the
         sex,' one critic of anti-seduction law stated, 'to view them as but passive
         subjects of the wiles of men,—as beings void of understanding, having neither
         power nor will of their own.' By depicting the female as a 'victim,' the
         anti-seduction statute imposed another double standard. The male was punished
         for having illicit sex, while the female was not. Still further hampering the
         law's enforcement was the phrase of 'previous chaste character.' This gave the
         accused seducer's lawyers an opening to challenge the woman's character—in
         other words, to put her on trial. For every character witness that she
         produced, the accused would be able to counter with witnesses who called her
         reputation into question" (141-43).
