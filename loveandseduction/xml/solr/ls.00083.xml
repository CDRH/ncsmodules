         "Maggie's [Maggie Tulliver of George Eliot's The Mill on the Floss] sexuality—what would seem to be most
         natural about her—is further commodified and channeled into the work of class
         demarcation in a sequence of passages about her arms, which serve as genteel
         metonymies for her breasts.  Euphemistically described as 'broad-chested' as an adolescent, Maggie irritates her Aunt Pullet
         by having shoulders too broad to fit into her old clothes. . . Just prior to this scene Maggie has begun to fulfill her desire
         to learn how to row.  Maggie becomes a strong rower, as befits a miller's daughter; her arms express not only sexual energy
         but also her connection to the older economy in which women of her class were not afraid of manual work.
         In her encounters with Stephen [Guest], by contrast, relying on his firm arm is one of her intoxicating pleasures.  The sensation
         of relative weakness defines her desire for Stephen as a signifier of leisure class status. . . .At the dance, Maggie wears
         the hand-me-down that
         had to be altered to expose her too-large arms, sometimes strong, now
         deferentially weak, and Stephen passionately kisses one of them in a passage that
         defines his desire too as that of the leisured consumer (of things, and also in
         his case of women, or rather of women as things). As they walk in the
         conservatory, itself a sign of conspicuous consumption, the narrative
         fetishizes Maggie's arm on Stephen's behalf: 
         Stephen . . . was incapable of putting a sentence together, and Maggie bent her arm a little upward towards the large, half-opened
         rose that had attracted her.  Who has not felt the beauty of a woman's arm?  The unspeakable suggestions of tenderness that
         lie in the dimpled elbow, and all the varied gently lessening curves down to the delicate wrist, with its tiniest, almost
         imperceptible nicks in the firm softness.  A woman's arm touched the soul of a great sculptor two thousand years ago so that
         he wrought an image of it for the Parthenon which moves us still as it clasps lovingly the timeworn marble of a headless trunk.
         Maggie's arm was such an arm, and it had the warm tints of life.  A mad impulse seized on Stephen; he darted towards the arm
         and showered kisses on it, clasping the wrist. . . . 
         It is an important feature of the class meanings
         of this scene that Maggie protests against the kiss. To accept it
         uncomplainingly, much less to reciprocate it, would be the act of a lower-class
         woman, and Maggie's feeling of 'humiliation' ('what right have I given you to
         insult me?') makes it clear that she wishes to be understood as Stephen's
         equal. Her sense of equality depends on a desired but impossible erasure of
         class boundaries; in actuality they can be equals morally or erotically, but
         not socially. That Maggie nonetheless imagines their social equality
         contributes to the novel's consolidation of middle-class dominance by
         representing middle-class values, such as the propriety and respectability
         Maggie adheres to, as cross-class ideals. Her natural instincts are also
         middle-class ones. Stephen seeks to consume Maggie much as Arthur [in Eliot's earlier novel, Adam Bede] purchases
         Hetty, but Maggie's resistance makes her the middle-class—that is, classless—figure Hetty can never be" (34-35).
