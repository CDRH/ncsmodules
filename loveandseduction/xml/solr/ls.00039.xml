      <field name="text">The wrathful cry of
         sensationalism, "that Cry of cries" for the 1860s, made the rounds of the critical journals and became established in their
         lexicon as a fashionable slogan, with
         automatic, if somewhat vague, connotations. The word itself, with its aura of
         patronizing disapproval, became an instrument of the status quo, in world view
         as well as fictional practice. In fact, according to All the Year Round, it
         took on the quality of an "orthodox stone," convenient for the
         "flinging at any heretic author who is bold enough to think that life has
         its tremendous passes of anguish and crime, as well as its little joys and
         little sorrows." By 1864, M. E. Braddon had already
         begun to feel its effect as a "bitter term of reproach...invented for
         the terror of romancers." One reviewer in Belgravia, Miss
         Braddon's publication, objected to the slogan as a "hollow, windy,
         worthless ululation," and it is certainly true that both sides used the
         term loosely, stretching its original application to a specific genre for
         their own polemical purposes. For the critics, sensationalism was apt to
         include the lower reaches of Reynolds' Miscellany and the Newgate
         Calendar, yellow journalism, Coburg melodrama, and spasmodic poetryâ€”anything,
         in short, from "mere trash" to "something worse." For the
         apologists, with their loftier conception, it encompassed Shakespeare and
         Sophocles as well as the Poet Laureate, whose popular verse "Enoch
         Arden" turns on the heroine's unintentional bigamy. Both sides pointed to
         Dickens, in triumph or in accusation. Belgravia claimed him as the
         "founder" of the sensation school, while Blackwood's reviewed Great Expectations 
         along with all the other
         current sensation novels, judging it much inferior to The
         Woman in White as a specimen of the genre: "With the most fantastic
         exaggeration of means, here is no result at all achieved, and no sensation
         produced upon the composed intelligence of the reader. ... In every way, Mr.
         Dickens's performance must yield precedence to the companion work of his
         disciple and assistant."During the 1860s, both readers and reviewers were on the lookout for
         sensation, whether to devour it in shilling numbers or to denounce it from
         literary pulpits. For some, like Charles Reade, it is the constitutive element
         of fiction: "Without sensation there can be no interest." For others,
         like the worthy Dean Mansel in the Quarterly, the only sensation
         provoked is a distinctly unpleasant one, as certain popular novels "with
         or without the intention of the writer, are strongly provocative of that
         sensation in the palate and throat which is a premonitory symptom of
         nausea." In any event, sensation was in the air, a part of the temper of
         the times.As a separate
         genre, the sensation novel now looks irretrievably minor in the context of
         literary history. It became a genre in its own right through the process of
         revising the ancient verities of romance and melodrama, and through the
         same process, abolished itself as a viable and relevant means of expression.
         Still, there are remnants of its brief popular reign even in the major realist
         works of the sensation decade. One obvious way for its influence to surface is
         in the form of parody, to which the sensation novel was particularly susceptible
         because of its transitional status. As early as 1864, the Edinburgh
         Review was reporting that "two or three years ago nobody would have
         known what was meant by a Sensation Novel; yet now the term has already passed
         through the stage of jocular use ... and has been adopted as the regular
         commercial name for a particular product of industry for which there is just now
         a brisk demand." The jocular meaning seems to have
         coexisted quite comfortably with the serious one, diminishing neither the sales
         nor the impact of the sensation genre. In fact, the irreverent imitations in 
         Punch
         
         appear to have attracted a following of their own; at one
         point, the
         Examiner 
         ironically recommended that
         Mrs. Henry Wood, to keep up her standing in the public favor, ought to
         read "the thrilling romance of 'Mokeanna,' and write something like that."
         And of course, M. E. Braddon, who sometimes wrote for 
         Punch,
         
         enjoyed poking fun at the very conventions she had done so
         much to establish in the first place.
