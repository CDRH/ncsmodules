      <field name="text">Scene Two: Another villain attempts rape on the heroine in her boudoirCAPITOLA's blood
         seemed turned to ice, and her form to stone by the sight! Her first impulse was
         to scream and let fall the waiter! She controlled herself and repressed the
         scream though she was very near dropping the waiter. Black Donald looked
         at her and laughed aloud at her consternation, saying with a chuckle: "You did not
         expect to see me here to-night, did you now, my dear?" She gazed at him in
         a silent panic for a moment. Then her faculties,
         that had been suddenly dispersed by the shock, as suddenly rallied to her
         rescue. In one moment she
         understood her real position. Black Donald had
         locked her in with himself and held the key—so she could not hope to get out. The loudest scream
         that she might utter would never reach the distant chamber of Major Warfield,
         or the still more remote apartment of Mrs. Condiment; so she could not hope to
         bring any one to her assistance. She was, therefore,
         entirely in the power of Black Donald. She fully comprehended this, and said to
         herself: "Now, my dear
         Cap, if you don't look sharp your hour is come! Nothing on earth will save
         you, Cap, but your own wits! For if ever I saw mischief in any one's face, it
         is in that fellow's that is eating you up with his great eyes at the same time
         that he is laughing at you with his big mouth! Now, Cap, my little man, be a
         woman! Don't you stick at trifles! Think of Jael and Sisera! Think of Judith
         and Holofernes! And the devil and Doctor Faust, if necessary, and don't you
         blanch! All stratagems are fair in love and war—especially in war, and most
         especially in such a war as this is likely to be—a contest in close quarters for
         dear life!" All this passed
         through her mind in one moment, and in the next her plan was formed. Setting her waiter
         down upon the table and throwing herself into one of the armchairs; she said: "Well, upon my word! I think a gentleman might
         let a lady know when he means to pay her a
         domiciliary visit at midnight!" "Upon my word,
         I think you are very cool!" replied Black Donald, throwing himself into
         the second armchair on the other side of the stand of refreshments. "People are
         likely to be cool on a December night, with the thermometer at zero, and the
         ground three feet under the snow," said Cap, nothing daunted. "Capitola, I
         admire you! You are a cucumber! That's what you are, a cucumber!" "A pickled one?" asked Cap. "Yes, and as
         pickled cucumbers are good to give one an appetite, I think I shall fall to and
         eat." "Do so,"
         said Cap, "for heaven forbid that I should fail in hospitality!" "Why, really,
         this looks as though you had expected a visitor—doesn't it?" asked Black
         Donald, helping himself to a huge slice of ham, and stretching his feet out
         toward the fire. "Well, yes,
         rather; though, to say the truth, it was not your reverence I expected,"
         said Cap. "Ah! somebody
         else's reverence, eh? Well, let them come! I'll be ready for them!" said
         the outlaw, pouring out and quaffing a large glass of brandy. He drank it, set
         down the glass, and turning to our little heroine, inquired: "Capitola did
         you ever have Craven Le Noir here to supper with you?" "You insult me! I scorn to reply!" said Cap. "Whe-ew! What
         long whiskers our Grimalkin's got! You scorn to reply! Then you really are
         not afraid of me?" asked the robber, rolling a great piece of cheese in
         his mouth. "Afraid of you?
         No, I guess not!" replied Cap, with a toss of her head. "Yet, I might
         do you some harm." "But, you won't!" "Why won't I?" "Because it
         won't pay!" "Why wouldn't
         it?" "Because you
         couldn't do me any harm, unless you were to kill me, and you would gain nothing
         by my death, except a few trinkets that you may have without." "Then, you are
         really not afraid of me?" he asked, taking another deep draught of brandy.
         "Not a bit of
         it—I rather like you!" "Come, now,
         you're running a rig upon a fellow," said the outlaw, winking and
         depositing a huge chunk of bread in his capacious jaws. "No, indeed ! I
         liked you, long before I ever saw you ! I always did like people that make
         other people's hair stand on end ! Don't you remember when you first came here
         disguised as a peddler, though I did not know who you were, when we were
         talking of Black Donald, and everybody was abusing him, except myself? I took
         his part and said that for my part I liked Black Donald and wanted to see
         him." "Sure enough,
         my jewel, so you did ! And didn't I bravely risk my life by throwing off my
         disguise to gratify your laudable wish ?" "So you did, my
         hero!" "Ah, but well
         as you liked me, the moment you thought me in your power didn't you leap upon
         my shoulders like a catamount and cling there, shouting to all the world to
         come and help you, for you had caught Black Donald and would die before you
         would give him up ? Ah ! you little vampire, how you thirsted for my blood !
         And you pretended to like me !" said Black Donald, eying her from head to
         foot, with a sly leer. Cap returned the
         look with interest. Dropping her head on one side, she glanced upward from the
         corner of her eye, with an expression of "infinite" mischief and
         roguery, saying "Lor, didn't
         you know why I did that?" "Because you
         wanted me captured, I suppose." "No, indeed,
         but, because—" "Well, what
         ?" "Because I
         wanted you to carry me off !" "Well, I
         declare ! I never thought of that !" said the outlaw, dropping his bread
         and cheese, and staring at the young girl. "Well, you
         might have thought of it then ! I was tired of hum-drum life, and I wanted to
         see adventures !" said Cap Black Donald looked
         at the mad girl from head to foot and then said, coolly: "Miss Black. I
         am afraid you are not good." "Yes I
         am—before folks !" said Cap. "And so you
         really wished me to carry you off?" "I should think
         so ! Didn't I stick to you until you dropped me ?" "Certainly! And
         now if you really like me as well as you say you do, come give me a kiss."
         "I won't
         !" said Cap, "until you have done your supper and washed your face!
         Your beard is full of crumbs !" "Very well, I
         can wait awhile ! Meantime just brew me a bowl of egg-nog, by way of a
         night-cap, will you?" said the outlaw, drawing off his boots and
         stretching his feet to the fire. "Agreed, but it
         takes two to make egg-nog; you'll have to whisk up the whites of the eggs into
         a froth, while I beat the yellows, and mix the other ingredients," said
         Cap. "Just so,"
         assented the outlaw, standing up and taking off his coat and flinging it upon
         the floor. Cap shuddered, but went
         on calmly with her preparations. There were two little white bowls setting one
         within the other upon the table. Cap took then apart and set them side by side
         and began to break the eggs, letting the whites slip into one bowl and dropping
         the yellows into the other. Black Donald sat
         down in his shirt sleeves, took one of the bowls from Capitola and began to
         whisk up the whites with all his might and main. Capitola beat up the
         yellows, gradually mixing the sugar with it. In the course of her work she complained
         that the heat of the fire scorched her face, and she drew her chair farther
         towards the corner of the chimney, and pulled the stand after her. "Oh, you are
         trying to get away from me," said Black Donald, hitching his own chair in
         the same direction, close to the stand, so that he sat immediately in front of
         the fire Cap smiled and went
         on beating her eggs and sugar together. Then she stirred in the brandy and
         poured in the milk and took the bowl from Black Donald and laid on the foam.
         Finally, she filled a goblet with the rich compound and handed it to her
         uncanny guest. Black Donald untied
         his neck cloth, threw it upon the floor and sipped his egg-nog, all the while
         looking over the top of the glass at Capitola. "Miss
         Black," he said, "it must be past twelve o'clock." "I suppose it
         is," said Cap. "Then it must
         be long past your usual hour of retiring." "Of course it
         is," said Cap. "Then what are
         you waiting for?" "For my company
         to go home," replied Cap. "Meaning me
         ?" "Meaning
         you." "Oh, don't mind
         me, my dear." "Very
         well," said Cap, "I shall not trouble myself about you," and her
         tones were steady, though her heart seemed turned into a ball of ice, through
         terror. Black Donald went on
         slowly sipping his egg-nog, filling up his goblet when it was empty, and
         looking at Capitola over the top of his glass. At last he said: "I have been
         watching you, Miss Black." "Little need to
         tell me that," said Cap. "And I have
         been reading you." "Well, I hope
         the page was entertaining." "Well, yes, my
         dear, it was, rather so. But why don't you proceed?" "Proceed—with
         what ?" "With what you
         are thinking of, my darling." "I don't
         understand you !" "Why don't you
         offer to go down-stairs and bring up some lemons?" "Oh, I'll go in
         a moment," said Cap, "if you wish." "Ha—ha—ha—ha—ha!
         Of course you will, my darling! And you'd deliver me into the hands of the
         Philistines, just as you did my poor men when you fooled them about the
         victuals ! I know your tricks and all your acting has no other effect on me
         than to make me admire your wonderful coolness and courage; so, my dear, stop
         puzzling your little head with schemes to baffle me ! You are like the caged
         starling ! You can't—get—out !" chuckled Black Donald, hitching his chair
         nearer to hers. He was now right upon the center of the rug Capitola turned very
         pale, but not with fear, though Black Donald thought she did, and roared with
         laughter. "Have you done
         your supper? "she asked, with a sort of awful calmness. "Yes my
         duck," replied the outlaw, pouring the last of the egg-nog into his
         goblet, drinking it at a draught and chuckling as he set down the glass. Capitola then lifted
         the stand with the refreshments to remove it to its usual place. "What are you
         going to do, my dear?" asked Black Donald. "Clear away the
         things and set the room in order," said Capitola, in the same awfully calm
         tone. "A nice little
         housewife you'll make, my duck !" said Black Donald. Capitola set the
         stand in its comer end then removed her own armchair to its place before the
         dressing bureau. Nothing now remained
         upon the rug except Black Donald seated in the armchair! Capitola paused; her
         blood seemed freezing in her veins; her heart beat thickly; her throat was
         choked; her head full nearly to bursting, and her eyes were veiled by a
         blinding film. "Come—come—my
         duck—make haste; it is late; haven't you done setting the room in order
         yet?" said Black Donald, impatiently. "In one
         moment," said Capitola, coming behind his chair and leaning upon the back
         of it. "Donald,"
         she said, with dreadful calmness, "I will not now call you Black Donald! I
         will call you as your poor mother did, when your young soul was as white as
         your skin, before she ever dreamed her boy would grow black with crime! I will
         call you simply Donald, and entreat you to hear me for a few minutes." "Talk on, then,
         but talk fast, and leave my mother alone ! Let the dead rest !" exclaimed
         the outlaw, with a violent convulsion of his bearded chin and lip that did not
         escape the notice of Capitola, who hoped some good of this betrayal of feeling.
         "Donald,"
         she said, "men call you a man of blood; they say that your hand is red and
         your soul black with crime !" "They may say
         what they like—I care not!" laughed the outlaw. "But I do not
         believe all this of you ! I believe that there is good m all, and much good in
         you; that there is hope for all, and strong hope for you !" "Bosh ! Stop
         talking poetry ! 'Tain't in my line, nor yours, either !" laughed Black
         Donald. "But truth is
         in all our lines. Donald, I repeat it, men call you a man of blood ! They say
         that your hands are red and your soul black with sin ! Black Donald, they call
         you ! But, Donald, you have never yet stained your soul with a crime as black
         as that which you think of perpetrating to-night !" "It must be one
         o'clock, and I'm tired," replied the outlaw, with a yawn. "All your
         former acts," continued Capitola, in the same voice of awful calmness,
         "have been those of a bold, bad man ! This act would be that of a base one!" "Take care,
         girl—no bad names ! You are in my power—at my mercy !" "I know my
         position, but I must continue. Hitherto you have robbed mail coaches and broken
         into rich men's houses. In doing thus you have always boldly risked your life,
         often at such fearful odds that men have trembled at their firesides to hear of
         it. And even women, while deploring your crimes, have admired your
         courage." "I thank 'em
         kindly for it ! Women always like men with a spice of the devil in them !"
         laughed the outlaw. "No, they do
         not!" said Capitola, gravely. "They like men of strength, courage and
         spirit—but those qualities do not come from the Evil One, but from the Lord,
         who is the giver of all good. Your Creator, Donald, gave you the strength,
         courage and spirit that all men and women so much admire; but He did not give
         you these great powers that you might use them in the service of his enemy, the
         devil !" "I declare
         there is really something in that! I never thought of that before." "Nor ever
         thought, perhaps, that however misguided you may have been, there is really
         something great and good in yourself that might yet be used for the good of man
         and the glory of God !" said Capitola, solemnly. "Ha, ha, ha !
         Oh, you flatterer ! Come, have you done ? I tell you it is after one o'clock,
         and I am tired to death !" "Donald, in all
         your former acts of lawlessness your antagonists were strong men; and as you
         boldly risked your life in your depredations, your acts, though bad, were not
         base ! But now your antagonist is a feeble girl, who has been unfortunate from
         her very birth; to destroy her would be an act of baseness to which you never
         yet descended." "Bosh ! Who
         talks of destruction? I am tired of all this nonsense! I mean to carry you off
         and there's an end of it!" said the outlaw, doggedly, rising from his
         seat. "Stop !"
         said Capitola, turning ashen pale. "Stop—sit down and hear me for just
         five minutes—I will not tax your patience longer." The robber, with a
         loud laugh, sank again into his chair, saying: "Very well,
         talk on for just five minutes, and not a single second longer; but if you think
         in that time to persuade me to leave this room to-night without you, you are
         widely out of your reckoning, my duck, that's all." "Donald, do not
         sink your soul to perdition by a crime that heaven cannot pardon! Listen to me
         ! I have jewels here worth several thousand dollars ! If you will consent to go
         I will give them all to you and let you quietly out of the front door and never
         say one word to mortal of what has passed here to-night." "Ha, ha, ha !
         Why, my dear, how green you must think me ! What hinders me from possessing
         myself of your jewels, as well as of yourself !" said Black Donald,
         impatiently rising. "Sit still !
         The five minutes' grace are not half out yet," said Capitola, in a breathless
         voice. "So they are
         not ! I will keep my promise," replied Black Donald, laughing, and again
         dropping into his seat. "Donald, Uncle
         pays me a quarterly sum for pocket money, which is at least five times as much
         as I can spend in this quiet country place. It has been accumulating for years
         until now ! I have several thousand dollars all of my own. You shall have it if
         you will only go quietly away and leave me in peace!" prayed Capitola. "My dear, I
         intend to take that anyhow—take it as your bridal dower, you know ! For I'm
         going to carry you off and make an honest wife of you !" "Donald, give
         up this heinous purpose !" cried Capitola, in an agony of supplication, as
         she leaned over the back of the outlaw's chair. "Yes, you know
         I will—ha—ha—ha !" laughed the robber. "Man, for your
         own sake give it up !" "Ha, ha, ha !
         for my sake !" "Yes, for yours! Black Donald, have you ever reflected on death ?" asked Capitola, in a
         low and terrible voice. "I have risked
         it often enough; but as to reflecting upon it—it will be time enough to do that
         when it comes ! I am a powerful man, in the prime and pride of life," said
         the athlete, stretching himself exultingly. "Yet it might
         come—death might come with sudden overwhelming power, and hurl you to destruction
         ! What a terrible thing for this magnificent frame of yours, this glorious
         handiwork of the Creator, to be hurled to swift destruction, and for the soul
         that animates it to be cast into hell !" "Bosh again !
         That is a subject for the pulpit, not for a pretty girl's room. If you really
         think me such a handsome man, why don't you go with me at once and say no more
         about it," roared the outlaw laughing. "Black
         Donald—will you leave my room?" cried Capitola, in an agony of prayer. "No !"
         answered the outlaw, mocking her tone. "Is there no
         inducement that I can hold out to you to leave me ?" "None !" Capitola raised
         herself from her leaning posture, took a step backward, so that she stood
         entirely free from the trapdoor, then slipping her foot under the rug, she
         placed it lightly on the spring-bolt, which she was careful not to press; the
         ample fall of her dress concealed the position of her foot. Capitola was now
         paler than a corpse, for hers was the pallor of a living horror! Her heart beat
         violently, her head throbbed, her voice was broken as she said; "Man, I will
         give you one more chance ! Oh, man, pity yourself as I pity you, and consent to
         leave me!" "Ha, ha, ha !
         It is quite likely that I will ! Isn't it, now? No, my duck, I haven't watched
         and planned for this chance for this long time past to give it up, now that you
         are in my power ! A likely story indeed! And now the five minutes' grace are
         quite up !" "Stop ! Don't
         move yet ! Before you stir, say: 'Lord, have mercy on me!'" said Capitola,
         solemnly. "Ha, ha, ha !
         That's a pretty idea ! Why should I say that?" "Say it to
         please me ! Only say it, Black Donald !" "But why to
         please you ?" "Because I wish
         not to kill both your body and soul—because I would not send you prayerless
         into the presence of your Creator ! For, Black Donald, within a few seconds
         your body will be hurled to swift destruction, and your soul will stand before
         the bar of God !" said Capitola, with her foot upon the spring of the
         concealed trap. She had scarcely
         ceased speaking before he bounded to his feet, whirled around and confronted
         her, like a lion at bay, roaring forth: "You have a
         revolver there, girl—move a finger and I shall throw myself upon you like an
         avalanche?" "I have no
         revolver—watch my hands as I take them forth, and see !" said Capitola,
         stretching her arms out toward him. "What do you
         mean, then, by your talk of sudden destruction?" inquired Black Donald, in
         a voice of thunder. "I mean that it
         hangs over you—that it is imminent! That it is not to be escaped ! Oh, man,
         call on God, for you have not a minute to live !" The outlaw gazed on
         her in astonishment. Well he might, for
         there she stood paler than marble—sterner than fate—with no look of human
         feeling about her, but the gleaming light of her terrible eyes, and the beading
         sweat upon her death-like brow. For an instant the
         outlaw gazed on her in consternation, and then, recovering himself he burst
         into a loud laugh, exclaiming: "Ha, ha, ha!
         Well, I suppose this is what people would call a piece of splendid acting! Do
         you expect to frighten me, my dear, as you did Craven Le Noir, with the
         peas!" "Say 'Lord have
         mercy on my soul'—say it, Black Donald—say it. I beseech you!" she prayed.
         "Ha, ha, ha, my
         dear ! You may say it for me! And to reward you, I will give you, such a kiss!
         It will put life into those marble cheeks of yours!" he laughed. "I will say it
         for you ! May the Lord pity and save Black Donald's soul, if that be yet
         possible, for the Saviour's sake !" prayed Capitola, in a broken voice,
         with her foot upon the concealed and fatal spring. He laughed aloud,
         stretched forth his arms and rushed to clasp her. She pressed the
         spring. The drop fell with a
         tremendous crash! The outlaw shot
         downwards—there was an instant's vision of a white and panic-stricken face, and
         wild, uplifted hands as he disappeared, and then a square, black opening, was
         all that remained where the terrible intruder had sat. No sight or sound
