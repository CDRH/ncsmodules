      <field name="text">Mingling with the presumed
         anti-family influences of female employment, especially factory employment,
         were apprehensions about the converging pressures of large-town life. Housing
         conditions, unsavoury courts, rookeries, and cellar dwellings, and overall
         chronic overcrowding, were denounced throughout the nineteenth century as
         inimical to domestic family life and as breeding grounds for all manner of vice
         and unnatural practices, as well as of misery. Where an entire family, husband,
         wife, and children of all ages and both sexes, lived in one room any notions of
         modesty and decency were grotesque, and chastity was thought to be an early
         casualty. Constant murmurings of incest reached the ears of polite society in
         the reports of slum visitors and parish clergy, the images of
         brother-and-sister, father-and-daughter relations thinly disguised in
         references to 'these breeding places of disease and vice and all manner of
         abomination'. If incest was at all common or prevalent, which seems most
         unlikely, its consequences at least must have been massaged away into conventional
         and respectable forms; the illegitimacy rate, never at all high, was tending to
         fall from around 7 per cent of all births in the early Victorian years to
         4 per cent or less by the close of the century. This must have been in the main
         the fruits of premarital and extramarital, rather than incestuous, intercourse.
         Similar goings-on, whatever they may have been, were probably more characteristic,
         and traditional, in rural areas than in the large towns, where in any case
         overcrowding was quite as prevalent as in the cities. Nevertheless,
         promiscuity, whether incestuous or not, was felt to be encouraged by urban
         housing conditions and to be further stimulated by the pubs, gin palaces, music
         halls, and other resorts of doubtful reputation which flourished in the larger
         towns, partly at least as refuges from the inadequacies and unattractiveness of
         home life. If to all this is added the virtual breakdown of organized religion
         in the larger towns, of which the more earnest of early Victorians were acutely
         conscious, then the full force of the supposedly pernicious effects of
         large-town life upon the institution of the family can be appreciated.
         Whether or not any or all of these
         apprehensions were well grounded, they were the perceptions which induced, or
         contributed to induce, a whole range of movements, campaigns, moral crusades,
         religious, educational, and political endeavours, that were intended to reform
         or correct the material and cultural environment so that, among other
         objectives, the family might be preserved from the perils which appeared to
         threaten it. These efforts, very largely but not totally misconceived and
         misplaced, will be considered more fully in later chapters, as external
         influences on working-class lives. They were, of course, very much internal
         influences on the lives of the middle classes, in the sense that they were
         largely generated by middle-class moralists and social reformers and
         presumptively reflected what were thought to be already existing habits and
         conditions within middle-class families. To this extent the content and aims of
         missionary efforts intended to save the working-class family are most
         informative about actual middle-class precepts and practices, and most of all
         perhaps about middle-class fears of the fragility of their own family ideals
         unless these were protected with constant vigilance by elaborate ramparts of
         morality, modesty, reticence, sexual segregation, parental discipline and
         authority, and male dominance. Any self-acknowledgement of such fragility was
         customarily phrased in terms of the need for barriers of privacy and propriety
         to protect the middle-class family from contamination by chance contact with
         vulgar and undesirable people and their corrupting habits, people who might
         include the raffish aristocracy as well as the great unwashed. The defences may
         also have been required to protect the middle-class family from the
         self-destructive potential of the desires and appetites of its own members. The
         double standard, of strict chastity for the girls and condonation of wild-oat
         sowing by the young men, never more than obliquely mentioned, was a tacit
         acknowledgement of this.
