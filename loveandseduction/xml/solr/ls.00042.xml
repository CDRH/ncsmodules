      <field name="text">Scene Two: Jo and Laurie flirt inconsequentially on a sofaWhen Laurie first went to college, he fell in love about
         once a month, but these small flames were as brief as ardent,
         did no damage, and much amused Jo, who took great interest in
         the alternations of hope, despair, and resignation, which were
         confided to her in their weekly conferences. But there came a
         time when Laurie ceased to worship at many shrines, hinted
         darkly at one all-absorbing passion, and indulged occasionally
         in Byronic fits of gloom. Then he avoided the tender subject
         altogether, wrote philosophical notes to Jo, turned studious,
         and gave out that he was going to 'dig', intending to graduate
         in a blaze of glory. This suited the young lady better than
         twilight confidences, tender pressures of the hand, and
         eloquent glances of the eye, for with Jo, brain developed
         earlier than heart, and she preferred imaginary heroes to
         real ones, because when tired of them, the former could be
         shut up in the tin kitchen till called for, and the latter
         were less manageable.Things were in this state when the grand discovery was
         made, and Jo watched Laurie that night as she had never done
         before. If she had not got the new idea into her head, she
         would have seen nothing unusual in the fact that Beth was
         very quiet, and Laurie very kind to her. But having given the
         rein to her lively fancy, it galloped away with her at a great
         pace, and common sense, being rather weakened by a long course
         of romance writing, did not come to the rescue. As usual Beth
         lay on the sofa and Laurie sat in a low chair close by, amusing
         her with all sorts of gossip, for she depended on her weekly
         'spin', and he never disappointed her. But that evening Jo
         fancied that Beth's eyes rested on the lively, dark face
         beside her with peculiar pleasure, and that she listened with
         intense interest to an account of some exciting cricket match,
         though the phrases, 'caught off a tice', 'stumped off his ground',
         and 'the leg hit for three', were as intelligible to her as
         Sanskrit. She also fancied, having set her heart upon seeing it,
         that she saw a certain increase of gentleness in Laurie's manner,
         that he dropped his voice now and then, laughed less than usual,
         was a little absent-minded, and settled the afghan over Beth's
         feet with an assiduity that was really almost tender."Who knows? Stranger things have happened," thought Jo,
         as she fussed about the room. "She will make quite an angel
         of him, and he will make life delightfully easy and pleasant
         for the dear, if they only love each other. I don't see how he
         can help it, and I do believe he would if the rest of us were out of
         the way."As everyone was out of the way but herself, Jo began to
         feel that she ought to dispose of herself with all speed. But
         where should she go?  And burning to lay herself upon the shrine
         of sisterly devotion, she sat down to settle that point.Now, the old sofa was a regular patriarch of a sofa—long,
         broad, well-cushioned, and low, a trifle shabby, as well it might
         be, for the girls had slept and sprawled on it as babies,
         fished over the back, rode on the arms, and had menageries
         under it as children, and rested tired heads, dreamed dreams,
         and listened to tender talk on it as young women. They all loved
         it, for it was a family refuge, and one corner had always been
         Jo's favorite lounging place. Among the many pillows that adorned
         the venerable couch was one, hard, round, covered with prickly
         horsehair, and furnished with a knobby button at each end. This
         repulsive pillow was her especial property, being used as a weapon
         of defense, a barricade, or a stern preventive of too much slumber.Laurie knew this pillow well, and had cause to regard it
         with
         deep aversion, having been unmercifully pummeled with it in former
         days when romping was allowed, and now frequently debarred by it
         from the seat he most coveted next to Jo in the sofa corner. If
         'the sausage' as they called it, stood on end, it was a sign that
         he might approach and repose, but if it lay flat across the sofa,
         woe to man, woman, or child who dared disturb it! That evening
         Jo forgot to barricade her corner, and had not been in her seat
         five minutes, before a massive form appeared beside her, and with
         both arms spread over the sofa back, both long legs stretched out
         before him, Laurie exclaimed, with a sigh of satisfaction:"Now, this is filling at the price.""No slang," snapped Jo, slamming
         down the pillow. But it was
         too late, there was no room for it, and coasting onto the floor,
         it disappeared in a most mysterious manner."Come, Jo, don't be thorny. After studying himself to a
         skeleton all the week, a fellow deserves petting and ought to get
         it.""Beth will pet you. I'm busy.""No, she's not to be bothered with me, but you like that sort
         of thing, unless you've suddenly lost your taste for it. Have you?
         Do you hate your boy, and want to fire pillows at him?"Anything more wheedlesome than that touching appeal was seldom
         heard, but Jo quenched 'her boy' by turning on him with a stern
         query, "How many bouquets have you sent Miss Randal this week?""Not one, upon my word. She's engaged. Now then.""I'm glad
         of it, that's one of your foolish extravagances,
         sending flowers and things to girls for whom you don't care two
         pins," continued Jo reprovingly."Sensible girls for whom I do care whole papers of pins won't let me
         send them 'flowers and things', so what can I do?  My feelings need a
         went.""Mother doesn't approve of flirting even in fun, and you do
         flirt desperately, Teddy.""I'd give anything if I could answer, 'So do you'. As I can't,
         I'll merely say that I don't see any harm in that pleasant little
         game, if all parties understand that it's only play.""Well, it does look pleasant, but I can't learn how it's done.
         I've tried, because one feels awkward in company not to do as
         everybody else is doing, but I don't seem to get on", said Jo,
         forgetting to play mentor."Take lessons of Amy, she has a regular talent for it.""Yes, she does it very prettily, and never
         seems to go too
         far. I suppose it's natural to some people to please without
         trying, and others to always say and do the wrong thing in the
         wrong place.""I'm glad you can't flirt. It's really refreshing to see a
         sensible, straightforward girl, who can be jolly and kind without
         making a fool of herself. Between ourselves, Jo, some of the
         girls I know really do go on at such a rate I'm ashamed of them.
         They don't mean any harm, I'm sure, but if they knew how we
         fellows talked about them afterward, they'd mend their ways, I
         fancy.""They do the same, and as their tongues are the sharpest,
         you fellows get the worst of it, for you are as silly as they,
         every bit. If you behaved properly, they would, but knowing
         you like their nonsense, they keep it up, and then you blame
         them.""Much you know about it, ma'am," said Laurie in a superior tone.
         "We don't like romps and flirts, though we may act as if
         we did sometimes. The pretty, modest girls are never
         talked about, except respectfully, among gentleman.
         Bless your innocent soul! If you could be in my place
         for a month you'd see things that would astonish you a trifle.
         Upon my word, when I see one of those harum-scarum girls,
         I always want to say with our friend Cock Robin:"Out upon you, fie upon you,Bold-faced jig!"It was impossible to help laughing
         at the funny conflict
         between Laurie's chivalrous reluctance to speak ill of womankind,
         and his very natural dislike of the unfeminine folly of
         which fashionable society showed him many samples. Jo knew
         that 'young Laurence' was regarded as a most eligible parti
         by worldly mamas, was much smiled upon by their daughters,
         and flattered enough by ladies of all ages to make a coxcomb
         of him, so she watched him rather jealously, fearing
         he would be spoiled, and rejoiced more than she confessed
         to find that he still believed in modest girls. Returning
         suddenly to her admonitory tone, she said, dropping her
         voice, "If you must have a 'went', Teddy, go and devote
         yourself to one of the 'pretty, modest girls' whom you do
         respect, and not waste your time with the silly ones.""You really advise it?" and Laurie looked at her with
         an odd mixture of anxiety and merriment in his face."Yes, I do, but you'd better wait till you are through
         college, on the whole, and be fitting yourself for the place
         meantime. You're not half good enough for—well, whoever
         the modest girl may be." and Jo looked a little queer likewise,
         for a name had almost escaped her."That I'm not!" acquiesced Laurie, with an expression of
         humility quite new to him, as he dropped his eyes and absently
         wound Jo's apron tassel round his finger."Mercy on us, this will never do," thought Jo, adding
         aloud, "Go and sing to me. I'm dying for some music, and
         always like yours.""I'd rather stay here, thank you.""Well, you can't, there isn't room. Go and make yourself
         useful, since you are too big to be ornamental. I thought you
         hated to be tied to a woman's apron string?" retorted Jo,
         quoting certain rebellious words of his own."Ah, that depends on who wears the apron!" and Laurie
         gave an audacious tweak at the tassel."Are you going?" demanded Jo, diving for the pillow.He fled at once, and the minute
         it was well, "Up with the
         bonnets of bonnie Dundee," she slipped away to return no more
         till the young gentleman departed in high dudgeon.
