      <field name="text">Scene Two:  Mary tries to disengage herself from the attentions of Mr. CarsonShe had wondered more than once if she must not
         have another interview with Mr. Carson; and had then determined, while she expressed her resolution that it should be the
         final one, to tell him how sorry she was if she had thoughtlessly given him false hopes.  For, be it remembered, she had the
         innocence, or the ignorance, to believe his intentions honourable; and he, feeling that at any price he must have her, only
         that he would obtain her as cheaply as he could, had never undeceived her; while Sally Leadbitter laughed in her sleeve at
         them both, and wondered how it would all end—whether Mary would gain her point of marriage, with her sly affectation of believing
         such to be Mr. Carson's intention in courting her.Not very far from the end of the street, into which the court where Mary
         lived opened, they met Mr. Carson, his hat a good deal slouched over his face, as if afraid of being recognised.  He turned
         when he saw them coming, and led the way without uttering a word (although they were close behind) to s street of half-finished
         houses.The length of the walk gave Mary time to recoil from the interview which was to follow; but even if her own resolve
         to go through with it had failed, there was the steady grasp of Sally Leadbitter, which she could not evade without an absolute
         struggle.At last he stopped in the shelter and concealment of a wooden fence, put up to keep the building rubbish from intruding
         on the foot-pavement.  Inside this fence, a minute afterwards, the girls were standing by him; Mary now returning Sally's
         detaining grasp with interest, for she had determined on the way to make her a witness, willing or unwilling, to the ensuing
         conversation.  But Sally's curiosity led her to be a very passive prisoner in Mary's hold.With more freedom than he had ever
         used before, Mr. Carson put his arm firmly round Mary's waist, in spite of her indignant resistance."Nay, nay! you little
         witch!  Now I have caught you, I shall keep you prisoner.  Tell me now what has made you run away from me so fast these few
         days—tell me, you sweet little coquette!"Mary ceased struggling, but turned so as to be almost opposite to him, while she
         spoke out calmly and boldly—"Mr. Carson!  I want to speak to you for once and for all.  Since I met you last Monday evening,
         I have made up my mind to have nothing more to do with you.  I know I've been wrong in leading you to think I liked you; but
         I believe I didn't rightly know my own mind; and I humbly beg your pardon, sir, if I've led you to think too much of me."For
         an instant he was surprised; the next, vanity came to his aid, and convinced him that she could only be joking.  He, young,
         agreeable, rich, handsome!  No! she was only showing a little womanly fondness for coquetting."You're a darling little rascal
         to go on in this way!  'Humbly begging my pardon if you've made me think too much of you.'  As if you didn't know I think
         of you from morning till night.  But you want to be told it again, do you?""No, indeed, sir, I don't.  I would far liefer
         that you should say you would never think of me again, than that you should speak of me in this way.  For, indeed, sir, I
         never was more in earnest than I am, when I say tonight is the last night I will ever speak to you.""Last night, you sweet
         little equivocator, but not last day.  Ha, Mary, I've caught you, have I?" as she, puzzled by his preseverance in thinking
         her joking, hesitated in what form she could now put her meaning."I mean, sir," she said sharply, "that I will never speak
         to you again, at any time, after tonight.""And what's made this change, Mary?" said he. seriously enough now.  "Have I done
         anything to offend you?" added he earnestly."No, sir," she answered gently, but yet firmly.  "I cannot tell you exactly why
         I've changed my mind; but I shall not alter it again; and, as I said before, I beg your pardon if I've done wrong by you.
         And now sir, if you please, good-night.""But I do not please.  You shall not go.  What have I done, Mary?  Tell me.  You must
         not go without telling me how I have vexed you.  What would you have me do?""Nothing, sir, but" (in an agitated tone), "oh!
         let me go!  You cannot change my mind; it's quite made up.  Oh, sir! why do you hold me so tight?  If you will know why I
         won't have anything more to do with you, it is that I cannot love you.  I have tried, and I really cannot."This naïve and
         candid avowal served her but little.  he could not understand how it could be true.  Some reason lurked behind.  He was passionately
         in love.  What should he do to tempt her?  A thought struck him."Listen! Mary.  Nay, I cannot let you go till you have heard
         me.  I do love you dearly; and I won't believe but what you love me a very little, just a very little.  Well, if you don't
         like to own it, never mind!  I only want now to tell you how much I love you, by what I am ready to give up for you.  You
         know (or perhaps you are not fully aware) how little my father and mother would like me to marry you.  So angry would they
         be, and so much ridicule should I have to brave, that of course I have never thought of it till now.  I thought we could be
         happy enough without marriage."  (Deep sank those words into Mary's heart.)  "But now, if you like, I'll get a licence tomorrow
         morning—nay, tonight, and I'll marry you in defiance of all the world, rather than give you up.  In a year or two my father
         will forgive me, and meanwhile you shall have every luxury money can purchase, and every charm that love can devise to make
         your life happy.  After all, my mother was but a factory girl."  (This was said to himself, as if to reconcile himself to
         this bold step.)  "Now, Mary, you see how willing I am to—to sacrifice a good deal for you; I even offer you marriage, to
         satisfy your little ambitious heart; so now, won't you say, you can love me a little, little bit?"He pulled her towards him.
         To his surprise, she still resisted.  Yes! though all she had pictred to herself for so many months in being the wife of Mr.
         Carson was now within her grasp, she resisted.  His speech had given her but one feeling, that of exceeding great relief.
         For she had dreaded, now she knew what true love was, to think of the attachment she might have created; the deep feeling
         her flirting conduct might have called out.  She had loaded herself with reproaches for the misery she might have caused.
         It was a relief to gather that the attachment was of that low despicable kind which can plan to seduce the object of its affection;
         that the feeling she had caused was shallow enough, for it only pretended to embrace self, at the expense of misery, the ruin,
         of one falsely termed beloved.  She need not be penitent to such a plotter! that was the relief."I am obliged to you, sir,
         for telling me what you have.  You may think I am a fool; but I did think you meant to marry me all along; and yet, thinking
         so, I felt I could not love you.  Still I felt sorry I had gone so far in keeping company with you.  Now, sir, I tell you,
         if I had loved you before, I don't think I should have loved you now you have told me you meant to ruin me; for that's the
         plain English of not meaning to marry me till just this minute.  I said I was sorry, and humbly begged your pardon; that was
         before I knew what you were.  Now I scorn you, sir, for plotting to ruin a poor girl.  Good-night."And with a wrench, for
         which she had reserved all her strength, she flew off like a bolt.  They heard her flying footsteps echo down the quiet street.
         The next sound was Sally's laugh, which grated on Mr. Carson's ears, and keenly irritated him.
