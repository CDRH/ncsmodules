      <field name="text">A Breach of Promise Trial in New YorkA case of seduction was tried at the Genesee
         Circuit, in this State, before Judge Dayton, which excited much interest—
         Jonathan Hutton vs. Benj. F. Green. It was clearly proved that the young
         woman, daughter of the plaintiff, was seduced and misled under a promise of
         marriage. The defence set up was most infamous — an attempt to prove the
         injured girl's character generally bad. The evidence in her favor was
         overwhelming — the more so, by the contrast with that brought against her. The
         result was a verdict of $900 for the complainant. Miss H. is a pretty young
         woman, with an expressively intellectual countenance. Her artless tale before
         the Court had a powerful effect in her favor; while the infamous ambiguity of
         her destroyer's had exactly the reverse.
