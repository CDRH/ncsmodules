      <field name="text">Scene One: The Villain proposes to the Ingenue in a parlourCraven Le Noir had
         never abated his unacceptable attentions to the orphan heiress. Day by day, on
         the contrary, to Clara's unspeakable distress, these attentions grew more
         pointed and alarming. At first she had
         received them coldly and repulsed them gently; but as they grew more ardent and
         devoted she became colder and more reserved, until at length, by maintaining a
         freezing hauteur at variance with her usually sweet temper, she sought to repel
         the declaration that was ever ready to fall from his lips. But, notwithstanding
         her evident abhorrence of his suit, Craven Le Noir persisted in his purpose. And so one morning
         he entered the parlor and, finding Clara alone, he closed the door, seated
         himself beside her, took her hand and made a formal declaration of love and
         proposal of marriage, urging his suit with all the eloquence of which he was
         master. Now, Clara Day, a
         Christian maiden, a recently bereaved orphan and an affianced bride, had too
         profound a regard for her duties toward God, her father's will and her
         betrothed husband's rights to treat this attempted invasion of her faith in any
         other than the most deliberate, serious and dignified manner. "I am very
         sorry, Mr. Le Noir, that it has at length come to this. I thought I had
         conducted myself in such a manner as totally to discourage any such purpose as
         this which you have just honored me by disclosing. Now, however, that the
         subject may be set at rest forever, I feel bound to announce to you that my
         hand is already plighted," said Clara, gravely. "But, my
         fairest and dearest love, your little hand cannot be plighted without the
         consent of your guardian, who would never countenance the impudent pretensions
         which I understand to be made by the low-born young man to whom I presume you
         allude. That engagement was a very foolish affair, my dear girl, and only to be
         palliated on the ground of your extreme childishness at the time of its being
         made. You must forget the whole matter, my sweetest love, and prepare yourself
         to listen to a suit more worthy of your social position," said Craven Le
         Noir, attempting to steal his arm around her waist. Clara coldly repelled
         him, saying: "I am at a loss
         to understand, Mr. Le Noir, what act of levity on my part has given you the
         assurance to offer me this affront!" "Do you call it
         an affront, fair cousin, that I lay my hand and heart and fortune at your
         feet?" "I have called
         your acts sir, by its gentlest name. Under the circumstances I might well have
         called it an outrage!" "And what may
         be those circumstances that convert an act of—adoration—into an outrage, my
         sweet cousin?" "Sir, you know
         them well. I have not concealed from you or my guardian that I am the affianced
         bride of Doctor Rocke, nor that our troth was plighted with the full consent of
         my dear father," said Clara, gravely. "Tut, tut, tut,
         my charming cousin, that was mere child's play—a school-girl's romantic whim.
         Do not dream that your guardian will ever permit you to throw yourself away
         upon that low-bred fellow." "Mr. Le Noir,
         if you permit yourself to address me in this manner, I shall feel compelled to
         retire. I cannot remain here to have my honored father's will and memory, and
         the rights of my betrothed, insulted in my person!" said Clara, rising to
         leave the room. "No—stay!
         forgive me, Clara! pardon me, gentlest girl, if, in my great love for you, I
         grow impatient of any other claim upon your heart, especially from such an
         unworthy quarter. Clara, you are a mere child, full of generous but romantic
         sentiments and dangerous impulses. You require extra vigilance and firm
         exercise of authority on the part of your guardian to save you from certain self-destruction.
         And some day, sweet girl, you will thank us for preserving you from the horrors
         of such a mésalliance," said Craven Le Noir, gently detaining her. "I tell you,
         Mr. Le Noir, that your manner of speaking of my betrothal is equally insulting
         to myself, Doctor Rocke and my dear father, who never would have plighted our
         hands had he considered our prospective marriage a mésalliance." "Nor do I
         suppose he ever did plight your handswhile in his right senses!" "Oh, sir, this
         has been discussed before. I beg of you to let the subject drop forever,
         remembering that I hold myself sacredly betrothed to Traverse Rocke, and
         ready—when, at my legal majority, he shall claim me—to redeem my plighted faith
         by becoming his wife." "Clara, this is
         madness! It must not be endured, nor shall not! I have hitherto sought to win
         your hand by showing you the great extent of my love; but be careful how you
         scorn that love or continue to taunt me with the mention of an unworthy rival.
         For, though I use gentle means, should I find them fail of their purpose, I
         shall know how to avail myself of harsher ones." Clara disdained
         reply, except by permitting her clear eye to pass over him from head to foot
         with an expression of consuming scorn that scathed him to the quick. "I tell you to
         be careful, Clara Day! I come to you armed with the authority of your legal
         guardian, my father, Colonel Le Noir, who will forestall your foolish purpose
         of throwing yourself and your fortune away upon a beggar, even though to do so
         he strain his authority and coerce you into taking a more suitable
         companion," said Craven Le Noir, rising impatiently and pacing the floor.
         But no sooner had he spoken these words than he saw how greatly he had injured
         his cause and repented them. Going to Clara and intercepting her as she was
         about to leave the room, he gently took her hand and, dropping his eyes to the
         floor with a look of humility and penitence, he said: "Clara, my
         sweet cousin, I know not how sufficiently to express my sorrow at having been
         hurried into harshness toward you—toward you whom I love more than my own soul
         and whom it is the fondest wish of my heart to call wife. I can only excuse
         myself for this or any future extravagance of manner by my excessive love for
         you and the jealousy that maddens my brain at the bare mention of my rival.
         That is it, sweet girl. Can you forgive one whom love and jealousy have hurried
         into frenzy?" "Mr. Le Noir,
         the Bible enjoins me to forgive injuries. I shall endeavor, when I can, to
         forgive you, though for the present my heart is still burning under the sense
         of wrongs done toward myself and those whom I love and esteem, and the only way
         in which you can make me forget what has just passed will be—never to repeat
         the offence." And with these words Clara bent her head and passed from the
         room. Could she have seen
         the malignant scowl and gesture with which Craven Le Noir followed her
         departure, she would scarcely have trusted his expressions of penitence. Lifting his arm
         above his head he fiercely shook his fist after her and exclaimed: "Go on,
         insolent girl, and imagine that you have humbled me; but the tune shall be
         changed by this day month, for before that time whatever power the law gives
         the husband over his wife and her property shall be mine over you and your
         possessions. Then we will see who shall be insolent; then we shall see whose
         proud blue eye shall day after day dare to look up and rebuke me. Oh! to get
         you in my power, my girl! Not that I love you, moon-faced creature, but I want
         your possessions, which is quite as strong an incentive."
