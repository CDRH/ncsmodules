      <field name="text">A coquette is a graduate in the science
         of flirtation, who has taken every degree from her alma-mater — who is so good
         a mistress of arts that she no longer needs a tutor, and is competent to manage
         her own affairs without the aid of a chaperon. Being, according to Ben
         D'Israeli, a "Psychological curiosity," she undergoes two changes before
         arriving at maturity: — From the insect of the school-period she becomes the
         chrysalis of the ball-room, whence she emerges from beneath the wing of her
         chaperon to flutter forth the full-grown butterfly, or coquette.A finished coquette is pretty, intellectual, and
         very fond of waltzing. She can, at a moment's notice, be intensely agreeable,
         or quietly repellant; she can smile with one side of her face upon a new
         conquest, and frown with the other upon his waning rival. She has a scale of
         attractions by which she measures her deportment towards different
         individuals. To a younger son, with small prospects, she is reserved and
         formal; to a captain of infantry, polite; to a ditto in the Guards,
         condescending. She is affable to the heir-presumptive of a rich title;
         affectionate and confiding to the heir apparent; but to the title itself,
         perfectly bewitching! She will walk a quadrille with a county member, but will
         not, if possible, waltz with anything under a peer. She can be a spirituelle
         to a wit, grave to a parson, and poetical to a minor. She knows
         instinctively the exact moment when to commence a flirtation; and — having no
         passion, no feelings — can adroitly break off an ineligible one, even if the
         wedding liveries have been ordered.To play off her arts with the proper degree of
         confidence — of carelessness about the result — of that seeming indifference to
         success which is the main element of success, the first duty of the coquette is
         to provide herself with a stock-lover — one who is so devotedly hers, that
         there is no fear of losing him even if all else should fail. It was
         not, therefore, till the Hounourable Mrs. Couple saw her protégée excellently
         provided in this respect, in the person of Sir Charles Simper, that she
         withdrew her valuable advice and services from Miss Rose Robinson. With the
         pride of a professor, who sees his pupil rise to celebrity and honour in his
         peculiar branch of learning, did the delighted chaperon point to her scholar as
         a perfect coquette."A large party of fashionables," observed the Morning
         Post of a recent date, "are assembled at the seat of the Lord Fallover, Fallover Park, Staffordshire. The young earl seems
         determined to emulate the hospitable
         liberality of his ancestors, for the following long list of distinguished
         fashionables are at present his guests." The names of Miss Robinson, Sir
         Charles Simper, and P. Pleinpurse, Esq., concluded the catalogue.It was here that Rose evinced herself a perfect
         mistress of her art. She had already nearly "entangled" one of the richest
         commoners in England — a dandy and dilettante; but her success in that quarter
         being doubtful, on account of the difficulty of managing a person so
         inordinately vain as Mr. Pleinpurse, she, with a laudable ambition, now aspired
         to her host. Lord Fallover was a fox-hunter and fancy farmer, who cursed the
         opera, and comprehensively criticized the whole of the fine arts as a bord; and
         her address, in sympathizing with the opposite tastes of these antipodes, won
         the admiration of some of her fellow-guests, and the envy of others. She spent
         her mornings in admiring Fallover's beagles, his patent ploughs, his enormous
         turnips, his obese oxen. She learnt all the good points of a horse, and
         praised his favourite hunters, as if she had graduated amongst "Scott's lot,"
         and finished her training at Tattersall's. She took the box-seat beside him
         when he drove his four-in-hand, and attended every "meet" in a red riding-habit.Thus, all the morning she was Fallover's Diana;
         but in the evening she became Pleinpurse's Euterpe. Then it was she melted her
         mellow tones into love songs, or raised her voice in the very heroic
         duetts of Donizetti. Then she was eloquent upon the sotto voce of
         Frezzolini, the aplomb of Lablache, the tremulando of Rubini. In
         the evening there was nothing she adored so much as music; in the morning
         brindle oxen were her passion; but just before dinner — when there was nobody
         else to flirt with — it was the society of Sir Charles Simper which she
         declared was so delightful.The party was rapidly breaking up — her mama was
         on the eve of returning — yet the Earl had not proposed. One last chance was
         given him; — he had bought a new horse, which was to be tried in the Tilbury,
         and Miss Robinson obtained the other seat in a drive round the Park. Fallover
         was by no means a loquacious man, and the lady made desperate efforts to draw
         him out by her own remarks: — "What a beautiful country! — a paradise! Thrice
         happy must be his lot to possess so charming an estate." And then, "A country
         life — how perfect a millennium — how far more attractive than the dissipations
         of London!" (a heart-breaking sigh accompanied the exclamation.) Lord
         Fallover assented to all she said, and pulled up at an elegant farm-house.
         With many apologies he borrowed a groom to drive her back to the Hall — "He had
         business with his tenant, Mr. Aacres."Rose remembered that this identical tenant had a
         lovely daughter and determined to dine in London that day. Pleinpurse had
         offered her mama and her seats in his carriage — (the servants could go to town
         in Simper's) — and on arriving at the Hall the offer was accepted.That journey did wonders with Pleipurse; and a
         week after the affair was arranged, all but giving a handsome congé to
         Simper. Rose would not, however, do so till the settlements had been actually
         signed; for no coquette is justified in turning off a lover till his chance is
         hopeless. The Earl had married the farmer's daughter, to the utter disgust of
         every chaperon and coquette of his acquaintance.Leaving Miss Robinson for the present, let us
         remark, that whilst the accomplished coquette wins our astonishment by the
         excess of her ingenuity, her perfect nerve on occasions of the most startling embarras,
         and her Protean changes of demeanour, — the clumsy maladroit flirt,
         who possesses all the desires without any of the arts of coquetry, excites that
         which would come very near contempt, if so strong a word can be justly applied
         to any of the "angels of life."Inferior kinds of coquettes are only to be met
         with in inferior classes of society. They are known at a glance — they wear
         very low dresses and large quantities of jewellery. They smell strongly of
         Rowland's Kalydor, which is sometimes accompanied with a suspicion of pomatum.
         They talk a vast deal, and frequently laugh in spite of their teeth. To their
         admirers they are guilty of either of the most lavish fondness or the most
         unpardonable rudeness. They make any engagement that is offered, and break it
         without the smallest compunction. Flattery is their food, caprice their rule
         of conduct. In a word, as the proficient coquette is the elegant,
         beautifully-tinted butterfly, so the ill-bred flirt is the mere moth. The
         former ends her existence as a chaperon — the latter as something worse; for
         coquetry hovers so near the extremest edge of virtue's limits, that without the
         vigilant exercise of the finest art, the boundary is sure to be over-stepped.
