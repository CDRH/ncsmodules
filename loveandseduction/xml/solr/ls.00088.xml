      <field name="text">1. "Melodramatic, socially conscious, and erotically
         charged, the sensationalist novels of Charles Reade (1814-1884), including It
         Is Never Too Late to Mend (1853), Hard Cash (1863), Griffith
         Gaunt (1866) and The Cloister and the Hearth (1861), were hugely
         successful. Reade used notebooks of newspaper clippings to fashion his "matter
         of fact romances," which also protested oppressive conditions in prisons,
         mental asylums, and merchant ships....Though little known today, Reade enjoyed a
         contemporary reputation equal to that of Wilkie Collins and just behind those
         of Dickens and Eliot, well deserving of Henry James's praise for 'those great
         sympathetic guesses with which a real master attacks the truth'" (45).2. "At the Beecher-Tilton trial, Theodore Tilton
         testified that in July 1870, his wife Elizabeth tearfully confessed to him
         that, after long resistance, she had given in to Beecher's passionate
         importunities and had carried on an affair with him for close to eighteen
         months. Her confession, and Beecher's alleged admission of the affair to
         Tilton and others, were evidenced to the jury only through the second-hand
         recitals of Tilton and his witnesses. Not surprisingly, Beecher denied every
         word. Part of Theodore's claim was based on Elizabeth's own words, however.
         He alleged that reading Griffith Gaunt had convinced Elizabeth for the
         first time to reject Beecher's claim that their adultery was so "pure" that it
         did not violate her marriage vows. As proof, Tilton introduced a letter Elizabeth had written to him about a year after her
         initial confession. This key document
         merits full quotation:June 29, 1871My dear Theodore
         To-day, through the ministry of Catherine Gaunt, a character of fiction, my eyes have been opened, for the first time in my
         experience, so that I see clearly my sin. It was when I knew that I was loved, to suffer it to grow to a passion. A virtuous
         woman should
         check instantly an absorbing love. But it appeared to me in such false light.
         That the love I felt and received could harm no one, not even you, I have believed
         unfalteringly until 4 o'clock this afternoon, when the heavenly vision dawned on
         me. I see now, as never before, the wrong I have done you, and hasten
         immediately to ask your pardon, with a penitence so sincere that henceforth (if reason
         remains) you may trust me implicitly. Oh! my dear Theo., though your opinions are
         not restful or congenial to my soul, yet my own integrity and purity are a
         sacred and holy thing to me. Bless God, with me, for Catherine Gaunt, and for all the
         sure leadings of an all-wise and loving Providence. Yes; now I feel quite
         prepared to renew my marriage vow with you, to keep it as the Savior requireth,
         who looketh at the eye and the heart. Never before could I say this. I know not
         that you are yet able, or ever will be, to say this to me. Still, with what
         profound thankfulness that I am come to this sure foundation, and that my feet are
         planted on the rock of this great truth you cannot at all realize.When you yearn toward me with any
         true feeling, be assured of the tried, purified and restored love of ELIZABETH.Responding to Elizabeth's epistolary assertion
         that Reade's
         novel had triggered a profound moral reevaluation of her past life, lawyers for
         both sides described and interpreted the novel at length to the jury. In a
         three-link chain of interactive analysis, arguments about the novel's meaning
         were used to interpret the letter" (47-48).3. "Elizabeth Tilton approached the burning passions
         and bigamous illegitimacies of Griffith Gaunt with a set of skills and
         expectations developed through her participation in mid-Victorian sentimental
         and religious culture. Significantly, the most striking aspect of her
         "Catherine Gaunt" letter is its spirituality, a response that presumes an
         overpoweringly moral stimulus" (50).4. "Modern and Victorian critics identify the novel's
         steaminess as its most salient characteristic. And while they may disagree
         heartily about the advisability of encouraging female readers toward a more
         assertive sexuality, both sets of critics agree that, like other sensational bestsellers,
         Griffith Gaunt did just that. But if many readers found the work more
         salacious than seemly, Elizabeth Tilton was not among them. Her letter
         suggests that, for one reader at least, the novel's signifying center was
         precisely its capacity not just to render but to judge sexuality" (51).5. "The semiotic slippage reflected in Elizabeth's
         letter, its circulation of signification between heroine and reader, fictional
         and factual life story, was of course exactly what made it useful for Beecher's
         and Tilton's attorneys at trial...William Maxwell Evarts, Beecher's lead counsel,
         treated Griffith Gaunt as a black-letter narrative of the relations
         between Elizabeth, her husband, and Beecher. For him, the correspondence
         between fictional heroine and actual woman was absolute: Elizabeth was
         sexually faithful to her husband because Catherine Gaunt did not commit
         adultery with her priest" (53).6. "While it was the legal order that excluded her
         testimony from the trial, a decision permitting her to speak would not have
         been likely to produce any truly authentic self-expression. Elizabeth Tilton's
         correspondence and her out-of-court statements are a stunning record of
         inconsistency, registering throughout an urgent desire to be and to say what
         the men in her life wanted to have and to hear. Indeed, her various
         confessions and retractions must ultimately be read as the ventriloquized
         statements of whichever men happened to be dictating at the time" (57).  June 29, 1871My dear Theodore
