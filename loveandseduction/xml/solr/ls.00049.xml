      <field name="text">AND ANOTHERWhich is From the Very Quiet and Moral Little Town of Oxford, Ohio, and of Course she isPLUMP, PRETTY AND PIOUSHe
         Doesn't Pan Out Much on the First, But Then he is Awfully Pious and so RespectableBUT—THEY ALL DO ITOxford, O., May 1—Some
         months ago it was
         rumored that a well-known young unmarried lady of this place, whose family
         connections were of a high social standing, was enceinte. This was only
         known to a few, and by them kept from becoming general. In fact, when the
         truth became known last Friday week that she had given birth to a fine,
         bouncing girl baby weighing twelve pounds, it fell like a thunderbolt upon the
         masses of the good villagers. The young lady upon whom this misfortune fell is
         one Mary E. Morris, a lady of twenty five years of age, and the daughter of the
         late Mr. Morris, who died some five years ago, leaving a wife and six children,
         all of whom are living. No sooner had the fact become known that Miss Mary had
         given birth to an illegitimate child than people began to make inquiry as to
         who the father was. In this promiscuous casting about for the male parent a
         rumor was set afloat that Dr. Hill, a man of high respectability, of good
         report, a member and an officer in the Presbyterian Church, married, with a
         grown family, was the responsible party and the father of the child. No sooner
         had it reached his ears than he pronounced it a base falsehood, and, calling a
         meeting of the Session of the Church, demanded a full and public
         investigation. The Session was called, and he, being stated clerk of the same
         refused to act as such, when another member was elected to fill his place. A
         committee was then appointed, consisting of Rev. Dr. Robert D. Morris, an uncle
         of the unfortunate girl, and Rev. F.M. Wood, pastor of the Presbyterian Church,
         to visit the lady and ascertain who was the father of the child, Miss Mary
         Morris is also a member of the Presbyterian Church, but not what they call an
         active member—taking no part in the Sunday school work and but rarely
         attending church. The above committee, on Friday, April 17th,
         waited upon Miss Morris, and took with them Professor R.H. Bishop, a Notary
         Public, at which time she made the following affidavit, which exonerates Dr.
         Hill and charges the parentage of the child upon one R.A. Morten, a young man of twenty:"State of Ohio, County of Butler,
         ss.:"Before me, R.H. Bishop, a Notary Public in and
         for said county, personally came Mary E. Morris, of the village of Oxford, in
         said county and state, who, being by me duly sworn, deposes and says that she
         is now pregnant, and that she became so in or about the third week in July
         last; that the father of the unborn child is R.A. Morten jun., of said village
         of Oxford, and that neither previous to nor since the time mentioned above has
         she had sexual intercourse with any man, except the said R.A. Morten jun., and
         further this deponent saith not."Mary E. Morris""Witness: F.M. Woodward and R.D. Morris.""Sworn to and subscribed before me
         this 17th
         day of April, A.D. 1878.         R.H. Bishop.""[seal] Notary Public for Butler County Ohio."This affidavit was presented to
         a meeting of the
         Session as exonerating Dr. Hill from the charges and rumors connecting his name
         with being the father of the child.Morten jun., the young man whom the parentage of
         the child has been sworn by Miss Morris, is the son of R.A. Morten, a farmer
         living just on the outskirts of the village and is only twenty years of age.
         He is emphatic in his denial of being its father. He says he has often called
         upon Miss Mary's sister, but not upon her. That some two weeks before the
         birth of the child a friend came to him and told him of the condition of Miss
         Mary, and as he had been calling at the house, there were rumors afloat that he
         was the father. He says that on the same day he called at her house, when she
         met him at the door; that they went into the house where he told her what had
         been said, and wanted to know if it was true she was reporting him to be the
         father; that she said, "No, your name will be the last mentioned in this
         affair." He said that he then went away, thinking it was all right. As soon
         as the affidavit was made laying the charge to him, Revs. Morris and Wood called
         upon R.A. Morten, sen., and informed him of the fact. Mr. Morten went out to
         where his son was working and told him of the affidavit, when the son assured
         him he was not guilty, and Morten, sen., returned and informed the gentlemen
         that he believed his son innocent, and would fight it out to the bitter end.  The son then went before a Notary Public, and
         made the
         following counter affidavit, which, together with a statement from his father
         will be laid before the meeting of the session tomorrow."State of Ohio, Butler county, ss:"Before me, R.H. Bishop, a Notary
         Public in and
         for said county and state, personally came R.A. Morten, jun., aged twenty
         years, who made the solemn oath that he had been credibly informed that one
         Mary Morris had made affidavit charging him, the said R.A. Morten, jun., with
         being the father of her unborn child; and this affiant further testifies that
         he is not the father of said Mary Morris' unborn child nor any other child,
         born or unborn; and, further, that he never at any time or place had sexual
         intercourse with the said Mary Morris.R.A. Morten, Jun."Sworn to and subscribed before me this 19th day
         of April, A.D. 1878.    R.H. Bishop"Notary Public Butler county."The father of young Morten is deeply impressed
         with the truth of his son's assertion of his innocence, and proposes to see him
         through, as he calls it. He is a well-preserved man of seventy-eight years of
         age, and is highly respected by all who know him. He was formerly resident of Carthage, of which village he was at one time
         mayor. The following is his statement
         submitted in writing to the session.  "I knew nothing about the Dr. Hill slander until
         I was visited by Rev. Dr. Robert Morris and Rev. Mr. Wood, Wednesday afternoon,
         April 17, 1878, who gave me the astounding information that Miss Morris had
         made solemn oath in which she charges my son, R.A. Morten, jun., with being the
         father of her unborn child, and that she further states under oath that said
         unborn child was begotten at the house of Mrs. Ray in July last, while Mrs. Ray
         was at Connersville. The said Mary Morris was keeping house and taking care of
         her (Mrs. Ray's) children during her absence. And Mr. Wood further stated that
         Dr. Hill was charged with it, and that he (Dr. Hill) would not go himself, but
         got Mr. Furgerson, Miss Morris' grandfather, to get her affidavit to clear him of this charge.  Miss Ray says that she was
         not away from home in July, but
         in September she went to Connersville, Ind., to a county fair at said place.Mr. Morten, sen., says that, if necessary, the
         above statement can be proven by members of their own church.A call was made upon a near relative of the
         unfortunate lady, who was loath to talk about the matter. He said the young
         lady's mother was suffering most keenly from her daughter's disgrace, and that
         he was afraid her health and mind were affected beyond recovery; that they were
         in needy circumstances, and that since the death of her husband he had been
         supporting them; that whoever the guilty party was he should have manliness
         enough about him to come forward and offer them some assistance in this great
         trial. To the question as to whether any lawsuits would grow out of the
         affair, he said no, he thought there would not, as he should oppose anything of
         the kind. The affair is the topic of conversation in the village, and, of
         course, both sides have ardent friends and defenders, and a few there are who
         deeply sympathize with the unfortunate girl, while all do so for the stricken
         mother of the erring woman, whose downfall may bring her mother to an early
         death. There are all kinds of stories afloat of how certain parties had been
         followed after night and seen entering the lady's house, and that said parties
         were married men, etc., but how much truth there may be in them one cannot
         tell. It is expected the church investigation, if not a sham, gotten up to
         whitewash some one, will prove or disprove the many and damaging stories
         connecting a certain party's name with the scandal.In conversation with Miss Morris' relative, a
         gentleman, he said that young Morten visited Miss Mary about two weeks before
         her confinement and told her that he would not desert her but see her safely
         through her trouble, and told her she should not want for anything.  "State of Ohio, County of Butler, ss.:"Before me, R.H. Bishop, a Notary Public in and
