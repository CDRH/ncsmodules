      <field name="text">Scene Three: Adam and Hetty in the OrchardIt did not seem at all surprising that Adam said he would go too,
         and soon he and Hetty were left alone together on the walk by the
         filbert-trees, while the boys were busy elsewhere gathering the
         large unripe nuts to play at "cob-nut" with, and Totty was
         watching them with a puppylike air of contemplation. It was but a
         short time—hardly two months—since Adam had had his mind filled
         with delicious hopes as he stood by Hetty's side in this garden. 
         The remembrance of that scene had often been with him since
         Thursday evening: the sunlight through the apple-tree boughs, the
         red bunches, Hetty's sweet blush. It came importunately now, on
         this sad evening, with the low-hanging clouds, but he tried to
         suppress it, lest some emotion should impel him to say more than
         was needful for Hetty's sake."After what I saw on Thursday night, Hetty," he began, "you won't
         think me making too free in what I'm going to say. If you was
         being courted by any man as 'ud make you his wife, and I'd known
         you was fond of him and meant to have him, I should have no right
         to speak a word to you about it; but when I see you're being made
         love to by a gentleman as can never marry you, and doesna think o'
         marrying you, I feel bound t' interfere for you. I can't speak
         about it to them as are i' the place o' your parents, for that
         might bring worse trouble than's needful."Adam's words relieved one of Hetty's fears, but they also carried
         a meaning which sickened her with a strengthened foreboding. She
         was pale and trembling, and yet she would have angrily
         contradicted Adam, if she had dared to betray her feelings. But
         she was silent."You're so young, you know, Hetty," he went on, almost tenderly,
         "and y' haven't seen much o' what goes on in the world. It's
         right for me to do what I can to save you from getting into
         trouble for want o' your knowing where you're being led to. If
         anybody besides me knew what I know about your meeting a gentleman
         and having fine presents from him, they'd speak light on you, and
         you'd lose your character. And besides that, you'll have to
         suffer in your feelings, wi' giving your love to a man as can
         never marry you, so as he might take care of you all your life."Adam paused and looked at Hetty, who was plucking the leaves
         from
         the filbert-trees and tearing them up in her hand. Her little
         plans and preconcerted speeches had all forsaken her, like an ill-learnt lesson, under the terrible agitation produced by
         Adam's
         words. There was a cruel force in their calm certainty which
         threatened to grapple and crush her flimsy hopes and fancies. She
         wanted to resist them—she wanted to throw them off with angry
         contradiction—but the determination to conceal what she felt
         still governed her. It was nothing more than a blind prompting
         now, for she was unable to calculate the effect of her words."You've no right to say as I love him," she said, faintly, but
         impetuously, plucking another rough leaf and tearing it up. She
         was very beautiful in her paleness and agitation, with her dark
         childish eyes dilated and her breath shorter than usual. Adam's
         heart yearned over her as he looked at her. Ah, if he could but
         comfort her, and soothe her, and save her from this pain; if he
         had but some sort of strength that would enable him to rescue her
         poor troubled mind, as he would have rescued her body in the face
         of all danger!"I doubt it must be so, Hetty," he said, tenderly; "for I canna
         believe you'd let any man kiss you by yourselves, and give you a
         gold box with his hair, and go a-walking i' the Grove to meet him,
         if you didna love him. I'm not blaming you, for I know it 'ud
         begin by little and little, till at last you'd not be able to
         throw it off. It's him I blame for stealing your love i' that
         way, when he knew he could never make you the right amends. He's
         been trifling with you, and making a plaything of you, and caring
         nothing about you as a man ought to care.""Yes, he does care for me; I know better nor you," Hetty burst
         out. Everything was forgotten but the pain and anger she felt at
         Adam's words."Nay, Hetty," said Adam, "if he'd cared for you rightly, he'd
         never ha' behaved so. He told me himself he meant nothing by his
         kissing and presents, and he wanted to make me believe as you
         thought light of 'em too. But I know better nor that. I can't
         help thinking as you've been trusting to his loving you well
         enough to marry you, for all he's a gentleman. And that's why I
         must speak to you about it, Hetty, for fear you should be
         deceiving yourself. It's never entered his head the thought o'
         marrying you.""How do you know? How durst you say so?" said Hetty, pausing in
         her walk and trembling. The terrible decision of Adam's tone
         shook her with fear. She had no presence of mind left for the
         reflection that Arthur would have his reasons for not telling the
         truth to Adam. Her words and look were enough to determine Adam:
         he must give her the letter."Perhaps you can't believe me, Hetty, because you think too well
         of him—because you think he loves you better than he does. But
         I've got a letter i' my pocket, as he wrote himself for me to give
         you. I've not read the letter, but he says he's told you the
         truth in it. But before I give you the letter, consider, Hetty,
         and don't let it take too much hold on you. It wouldna ha' been
         good for you if he'd wanted to do such a mad thing as marry you:
         it 'ud ha' led to no happiness i' th' end."Hetty said nothing; she felt a revival of hope at the mention of a
         letter which Adam had not read. There would be something quite
         different in it from what he thought.Adam took out the letter, but he held it in his hand still, while
         he said, in a tone of tender entreaty, "Don't you bear me ill
         will, Hetty, because I'm the means o' bringing you this pain. God
         knows I'd ha' borne a good deal worse for the sake o' sparing it
         you. And think—there's nobody but me knows about this, and I'll
         take care of you as if I was your brother. You're the same as
         ever to me, for I don't believe you've done any wrong knowingly."Hetty had laid her hand on the letter, but Adam did not loose
         it
         till he had done speaking. She took no notice of what he said—
         she had not listened; but when he loosed the letter, she put it
         into her pocket, without opening it, and then began to walk more
         quickly, as if she wanted to go in."You're in the right not to read it just yet," said Adam. "Read
         it when you're by yourself. But stay out a little bit longer, and
         let us call the children: you look so white and ill, your aunt may
         take notice of it."Hetty heard the warning. It recalled to her the necessity of
         rallying her native powers of concealment, which had half given
         way under the shock of Adam's words. And she had the letter in
         her pocket: she was sure there was comfort in that letter in spite
         of Adam.
