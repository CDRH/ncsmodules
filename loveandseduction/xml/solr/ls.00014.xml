      <field name="text">Badgered BeecherPlymouth Church Experiences Another Throe
         of the Great Moral Earthquake.MRS. TILTON TELLS AGAIN.This Time she Swears it is so, for she Cannot Tell a Lie,
         and she did it — with her Little Hatch-it.THE BIGGEST CACKLE ON RECORD.A quiet man of thirty-five, walked into the
         newspaper offices of this city, on Monday afternoon, 15th inst.,
         with a slip of paper in his hand, on which was printed the following:"Mr. Ira B. Wheeler."My Dear Sir: A few weeks since,
         after long
         months of mental anguish, I told, as you know, a few friends, whom I had
         bitterly deceived, that the charge brought by my husband of adultery between
         myself and the Rev. Henry Ward Beecher was true, and that the lie I had lived
         so well the last four years had become intolerable to me. That statement I now
         solemnly reaffirm, and leave the truth with God, to whom also I commit myself,
         my children and all who must suffer. I know full well the explanations that
         will be sought by many for this acknowledgment — a desire to return to my
         husband, insanity, malice, everything save the true and only one: my quickened
         conscience and the sense of what is due to the cause of truth and justice.
         During all the complications of these years you have been my confidential
         friend, and therefore, I address this letter to you, authorizing and requesting
         you to secure in publication."Elizabeth R. Tilton."Brooklyn, April 13, 1878."The bearer was Mr. Wheeler himself, and he
         modestly said that he had been asked by Mrs. Tilton to give it to the
         newspapers. He was closely quizzed and he said that he had been a friend and
         adviser of Mrs. Tilton, having known her from childhood. He is a New York lawyer, and a resident of Elizabeth, N.J. Since
         her separation from Theodore he
         has acted professionally as her counsel. Being asked about the confession, he
         said that she freely made it, unbeknown either to her husband or to Mr.
         Beecher. He believed it was a sincere one, and that it was made from no other
         motive than the one given therein. Her conscience was troubling her, and it
         was a matter between her and her God to confess her sin as publicly as she had denied it.Being asked whether she had made
         the same confession to him,
         Mr. Wheeler answered that she had and to other persons also. Mr. Wheeler was
         manifestly sincere in what he said, and he convinced all with whom he spoke
         that the confession was genuine. The news fell like a thunderbolt on the Beecher party, although they one and all said they
         had been expecting it. Mr. S.V. White,
         treasurer of Plymouth Church, said that he did not doubt Mrs. Tilton had
         written it. The air had been full of it of late, and after it had become
         certain that Tilton and wife were to come together again the Beecher party were
         prepared for anything. The confession was doubtless the price of
         reconciliation. He did not know who I.B. Wheeler was, but he did know that of
         late threats to blackmail Mr. Beecher had been made. If money was not given
         the persons said there would be further scandal developments. Much of the
         newspaper talk on the subject of the reunion of the Tiltons was preparatory to
         the confession. Thomas G. Shearman said that he knew of the confession coming,
         and he believed it was genuine, but it was part and parcel of the bargain by
         which Tilton and wife are to live together again.  He referred to the
         affidavits made by Mrs. Tilton, in which she explicitly denied her guilt, and
         said that her latest confession was inconsistent with them. Others of the Beecher flock went further. They said that the woman
         is insane; that she is a liar and
         not to be believed. They reiterated that it is a blackmailing operation, and
         said that no attention would be paid to it. Reminded that Mrs. Tilton is yet a
         member of Plymouth Church in good and regular standing, they said that she
         would have to be expelled for lying.As the evening progressed the excitement grew
         very great on Brooklyn Heights. Troops of reporters hurried to Beecher's House.They were politely received. Mr. Beecher was
         not at home.
         They were told he was off lecturing, but his family could not tell where, other
         than it was somewhere up the line of the Erie railroad. Every member of the
         family asked said that they did not know where he was. When asked whether it
         was a practice for him to go off without saying where he was going, they
         answered that it was not. This was the first time he had done such a thing.
         Judge McCue, one of the justices of the Brooklyn city court, said: "Mrs.
         Tilton made an affidavit before me in my private office, in which she called
         Almighty God to witness her innocence, and then she assured me privately that
         the charges against her were the result of one of the basest and most malicious
         conspiracies ever known. She was emphatic in every denial. Well, those who
         believe in Mr. Beecher's guilt will be more than ever convinced, and those who
         believe in his innocence will adhere to their belief more zealously, and the
         whole unsavory scandal will be poured out upon the community again."Mr. Augustus Storrs, one of the investigating
         committee, said that he had not heard of a confession, although he had been
         told than there might be one. "Mrs. Moore," he said, "is a familiar person to
         the public. Her actions in that period when she went hither and thither
         denouncing Mr. Beecher and telling of her daughter's sin proved to her friends
         that she was out of her mind. Ex-Judge Nathan B. Morse, her husband, told me
         that she was not only unpleasant to be with, but unsafe. Now it would be very
         strange if Elizabeth Tilton hadn't something of her mother in her. I must say
         that from all I have heard I think that Mrs. Tilton is crazy. Certainly the
         spells which we have seen her in go to prove it. The confession may be
         authentic, but who will believe it?  A lie thrice told will have no effect."The news spread with wonderful speed, and it
         seemed to plunge the stately Columbia Heights into the same fever which raged
         so long in the summer of 1874, when every day brought a new surprise. Those
         who moved in the inner circle of Plymouth Church were prepared for the shock.
         The indications of the coming storm had appeared in many places, and faint
         intimations, albeit that they were speedily repressed cropped out in the
         newspaper columns. Every time the story was told that all the plans for
         putting the scandal to sleep were to be upset by Mrs. Tilton, an adroit answer
         was ready to destroy its strength. The wily Mr. Shearman had the fact that
         Mrs. Tilton was to turn on Mr. Beecher long before any one else, and he caused
         the rumors of a confession to be printed and then denied them so as to lull
         suspicion. All that could be done was done to avert the disaster of a
         confession. The threat of war seems first to have come from Mrs. Morse, Mrs.
         Tilton's mother. A gentleman possessed of all the facts said that early in the
         winter Mrs. Morse had visited Mr. Beecher and told him that Elizabeth had to be
         taken care of, and that if she was not liberally supported there would be
         trouble. Mr. Beecher consulted with some of his friends, and they agreed that
         it would not do for him to be known as the supporter of Mrs. Tilton after all
         the scandal, and they advised him not to pay her any money. Mrs. Morse renewed
         her demand, and, it is said, accompanied it with strong and abusive language,
         and wrote several pointed notes to Mr. Beecher, but without any effect. Mrs.
         Tilton was induced to start a school in Henry street under the promise of a
         liberal support from the families of Plymouth Church.She found, however, that she was not only not to be
         liberally supported, but that persons from whom she expected favor expressed
         the opinion that after her course she was not a fit person to instruct
         children. This stung her to desperation, and she threw up her school. She
         complained of her harsh treatment by Mr. Beecher and his friends, and after, as
         she said, they had used her for all their purposes, and she blamed herself for
         deserting her husband, who had been magnanimous to forgive her sin and to
         promise her protection. She wrote a letter to Mrs. Raymond, the wife of
         Professor Rossiter W. Raymond, which the reporter's informant said had been
         seen and read by several persons in Plymouth Church. He understood that she
         had written a similar letter, saying that she was no longer going to live in a
         lie, to Mrs. Anna Field, who accompanied her daily to the trial of the
         Tilton-Beecher suit.Women from Plymouth Church made frequent visits
         to her, and reported a growing change in her disposition toward Mr. Beecher.
         To one she said: "What viciousness all this trouble has brought out, to be
         sure; nearly every form of crime." A lady member of the Plymouth Church who has maintained friendly relations with Mrs. Tilton
         and her mother, Mrs. Morse,
         called on Mrs. Tilton, being, as she says, unable to sleep until she knew the
         truth or falsity of the alleged confession. Mrs. Tilton opened the door for
         her. The hair above her forehead had blanched to whiteness and she seemed to
         have grown ten years older with the last few weeks. The feelings of the visitor
         were so intense that she walked directly past Mrs. Tilton into the parlor
         without uttering a word. When Mrs. Tilton had entered the lady asked her,
         while both were yet standing: "Libby, what is all this trouble about?""There has been trouble enough, but what do you
         mean?" was the reply."Did you write the statement that purports to be
         your confession of guilt, and that has been sent to the newspapers for
         publication?""I did," replied Mrs. Tilton, firmly. "And
         every word of it is true.""How could you," continued the visitor, "sit for
         all this time perjuring yourself every day?""I don't know how I could do it," replied Mrs.
         Tilton, "but I did.""Did your daughters know what you now say is the
         truth before they went to Europe?""Yes, they did."Mrs. Tilton was almost broken down. She
         displayed wonderful courage in maintaining the rightfulness of her new attitude
         toward Mr. Beecher, but she was in a state of great nervous excitement."Has Mr. Tilton been supporting his children?"
         asked the visitor of Mrs. Morse."Sumptuously," replied the lady."Has he seen Mrs. Tilton lately?""He has had two interviews
         with her after his
         last return from lecturing, but he is now lecturing again — thousands of miles
         away."Mr. Beecher was out of the city to-night when
         Mrs. Tilton's letter was made public, and his whereabouts was not known save to
         a few friends. The Tribune telegraphed him a copy of the letter at a
         late hour, and received the following letter in reply:Waverly, N.Y., April 15, 1878."To the Editor of the New York Tribune:"I
         confront Mrs. Tilton's confession with an
         explicit and absolute denial. The testimony to her own innocence and mine,
         which for four years she had made to hundreds in private and public, before the
         court, in writing and orally, I declare to be true. And the allegations now
         made in contradiction of her uniform, solemn and unvarying statements hitherto
         made, I utterly deny. I declare to be innocent of the great transgression."Henry Ward Beecher.In conversation with a reporter
         in that town, he
         made the following statement: "Mrs. Tilton was examined repeatedly by my
         counsel, and plied with the most searching questions, and by her consistent and
         explicit testimony satisfied them all of her innocence and won their esteem.
         When the Council of 1876 was called, several interviews were arranged between
         her and eminent gentlemen, both of the clergy and of the law. In every case
         she satisfied them of her absolute innocence. Subsequently to that, at an
         interview, arranged for the purposes of giving prominence to her declarations
         and form to her testimony, which was taken down by a shorthand writer, and
         which I believe to be still in existence although I have never seen it, she
         elaborately and in detail reaffirmed her innocence and mine. These are the
         most prominent instances of her uniform testimony. It should be borne in mind
         that she first charged me with this offence to her husband. Upon my visiting
         her she withdrew it in writing. She subsequently renewed the charge. She then
         again and indignantly denied it, and left her husband's house, and for four
         years has continued, in every conceivable form and under the most solemn
         circumstances, to deny it, until now, when once again, for the third time, she
         renews it. Against this long and tortuous career, I oppose my uniform and
         unimpeachable truthfulness."A reporter, for the purpose of verifying the
         confession, called at the house of Mrs. Tilton, in Brooklyn. Mrs. Tilton
         herself answered the bell. She looked far better than in the past. There
         seemed, however, to be a much greater proportion of gray in her naturally black
         hair than there was two years ago. The reporter saw only a vague resemblance
         of her old self as she looked early in the trial, but a closer likeness to her
         as she appeared when, one morning toward the close of the suit, she arose and
         waited the reply of the judge to her written appeal for permission to testify.It was, however, Mrs. Tilton, beyond question,
         and she responded pleasantly when so addressed. The reporter had with him a
         copy of the card furnished by Mrs. Wheeler. Showing it to her and asking
         whether she had indeed written it and was desirous that it should be published,
         Mrs. Tilton flushed violently and cast down her eyes. Then, after a moment,
         she said, "The card was written by me.""And you authorized Mr. Wheeler to make it
         public?""Yes, sir," she said, and still with downcast
         eyes; "did he leave it with you? It's all right, sir."Mr. Moulton was interviewed in Albany. He spoke
         substantially as follows: "I was convinced the admission would be made, but I
         was hardly prepared to expect it at this time. I know it from my knowledge of the woman.  Elizabeth Tilton was so upright,
         so sincere minded that it
         was only a question of time when she should tell the truth. I remember that
         Theodore Tilton once asked me, 'Frank, do you believe Elizabeth will ever tell
         me before she dies?' and I answered him that she surely would. I think that
         Mr. Tilton came to expect that it would occur some day. He always believed in
         her abiding sense of truth and right. You may look through the record of the
         trial and you will not find an instance of his speaking of her harshly or even
         unkindly. He spoke of her as a white-souled woman. He always conceded that
         she was dominated and overcome by Mr. Beecher's influence in the guise of
         religion."At the residence of Mrs. Morse, the mother of
         Mrs. Tilton, where the latter is living, no information could be obtained. The
         door was soon opened a few inches, as far as a chain and bolt would permit.
         One of Theodore Tilton's sons then asked the visitor's errand. Upon being
         informed that he desired to see Mrs. Morse he demanded the inquirer's
         business. When told that it was a reporter who desired to see her concerning
         Mrs. Tilton's letter the lad promptly said, "Mrs. Morse has no information to
         impart to the press." A sharp voice from the top of the stairs called out,
         "Close the door," and the command was obeyed. "I don't know," said Colonel Beecher, "whether
         my father expected anything of this sort or not. We never talked to him about
         it, but I will say for my part that I am not surprised. I have known for the
         last six weeks that Mr. Tilton has been visiting his wife, and I was prepared
         for something of this sort. An hour since I was for the first time told of it
         by a friend." He declined, however, to give the name of his informant, and
         said most courteously, "You can well understand that as Mr. Beecher's son I do
         not care to discuss the matter at all. I cannot say what the result will be or
         what my father will do. He has born calumny for years. I am quite sure he can
         stand this, but it is cruel, sir, wickedly cruel."Mr. Ira B. Wheeler, to whom Mrs. Tilton's
         confession was addressed, stated that the letter was handed to him in New York by Mrs. Tilton herself. It was her own voluntary
         act, and was written from no
         one's dictation. It was entirely written by her and without suggestions from
         any one. She told Mr. Wheeler a few weeks ago that she had made a confession
         to a few friends. In conclusion he said: "I believe her to be actuated only
         by a desire to free her conscience from the load upon it. She wished to make
         the truth known in the matter. You may assert positively that Mr. Tilton knows
         nothing of the matter." "Mr. Ira B. Wheeler."My Dear Sir: A few weeks since, after long
         months of mental anguish, I told, as you know, a few friends, whom I had
         bitterly deceived, that the charge brought by my husband of adultery between
         myself and the Rev. Henry Ward Beecher was true, and that the lie I had lived
         so well the last four years had become intolerable to me. That statement I now
         solemnly reaffirm, and leave the truth with God, to whom also I commit myself,
         my children and all who must suffer. I know full well the explanations that
         will be sought by many for this acknowledgment — a desire to return to my
         husband, insanity, malice, everything save the true and only one: my quickened
         conscience and the sense of what is due to the cause of truth and justice.
         During all the complications of these years you have been my confidential
         friend, and therefore, I address this letter to you, authorizing and requesting
         you to secure in publication."Elizabeth R. Tilton."Brooklyn, April 13, 1878." Waverly, N.Y., April 15, 1878."To the Editor of the New York Tribune:"I confront Mrs. Tilton's confession with an
         explicit and absolute denial. The testimony to her own innocence and mine,
         which for four years she had made to hundreds in private and public, before the
         court, in writing and orally, I declare to be true. And the allegations now
         made in contradiction of her uniform, solemn and unvarying statements hitherto
         made, I utterly deny. I declare to be innocent of the great transgression."Henry Ward Beecher.
