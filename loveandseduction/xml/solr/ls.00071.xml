      <field name="text">Scene Four: Adam and Dinah's betrothal walkHe did not expect Dinah to be at home at this hour, but he got
         down from his horse and tied it at the little gate, that he might
         ask where she was gone to-day. He had set his mind on following
         her and bringing her home. She was gone to Sloman's End, a hamlet
         about three miles off, over the hill, the old woman told him—had
         set off directly after morning chapel, to preach in a cottage
         there, as her habit was. Anybody at the town would tell him the
         way to Sloman's End. So Adam got on his horse again and rode to
         the town, putting up at the old inn and taking a hasty dinner
         there in the company of the too chatty landlord, from whose
         friendly questions and reminiscences he was glad to escape as soon
         as possible and set out towards Sloman's End. With all his haste
         it was nearly four o'clock before he could set off, and he thought
         that as Dinah had gone so early, she would perhaps already be near
         returning. The little, grey, desolate-looking hamlet, unscreened
         by sheltering trees, lay in sight long before he reached it, and
         as he came near he could hear the sound of voices singing a hymn. 
         "Perhaps that's the last hymn before they come away," Adam
         thought. "I'll walk back a bit and turn again to meet her,
         farther off the village." He walked back till he got nearly to
         the top of the hill again, and seated himself on a loose stone,
         against the low wall, to watch till he should see the little black
         figure leaving the hamlet and winding up the hill. He chose this
         spot, almost at the top of the hill, because it was away from all
         eyes—no house, no cattle, not even a nibbling sheep near—no
         presence but the still lights and shadows and the great embracing
         sky.She was much longer coming than he expected. He waited an hour at
         least watching for her and thinking of her, while the afternoon
         shadows lengthened and the light grew softer. At last he saw the
         little black figure coming from between the grey houses and
         gradually approaching the foot of the hill. Slowly, Adam thought,
         but Dinah was really walking at her usual pace, with a light quiet
         step. Now she was beginning to wind along the path up the hill,
         but Adam would not move yet; he would not meet her too soon; he
         had set his heart on meeting her in this assured loneliness. And
         now he began to fear lest he should startle her too much. "Yet,"
         he thought, "she's not one to be overstartled; she's always so
         calm and quiet, as if she was prepared for anything."What was she thinking of as she wound up the hill? Perhaps she
         had found complete repose without him, and had ceased to feel any
         need of his love. On the verge of a decision we all tremble: hope
         pauses with fluttering wings.But now at last she was very near, and Adam rose from the stone
         wall. It happened that just as he walked forward, Dinah had
         paused and turned round to look back at the village—who does not
         pause and look back in mounting a hill? Adam was glad, for, with
         the fine instinct of a lover, he felt that it would be best for
         her to hear his voice before she saw him. He came within three
         paces of her and then said, "Dinah!" She started without looking
         round, as if she connected the sound with no place. "Dinah!" Adam
         said again. He knew quite well what was in her mind. She was so
         accustomed to think of impressions as purely spiritual monitions that she looked for no material visible accompaniment of
         the voice.But this second time she looked round. What a look of yearning
         love it was that the mild grey eyes turned on the strong dark-eyed
         man! She did not start again at the sight of him; she said
         nothing, but moved towards him so that his arm could clasp her
         round.And they walked on so in silence, while the warm tears fell. Adam
         was content, and said nothing. It was Dinah who spoke first."Adam," she said, "it is the Divine Will. My soul is so knit to
         yours that it is but a divided life I live without you. And this
         moment, now you are with me, and I feel that our hearts are filled
         with the same love. I have a fulness of strength to bear and do
         our heavenly Father's Will that I had lost before."Adam paused and looked into her sincere eyes."Then we'll never part any
         more, Dinah, till death parts us."And they kissed each other with a deep joy.What greater thing is there for two human souls
         than to feel that
         they are joined for life—to strengthen each other in all labour,
         to rest on each other in all sorrow, to minister to each other in
         all pain, to be one with each other in silent unspeakable memories
         at the moment of the last parting?
