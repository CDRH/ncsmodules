      <field name="text">1. "Hunt's gratification when he heard of Carlyle's
         'positive praise' encouraged him to repeat the invitations to see the Christ
         picture. First Carlyle peered at The Awakening Conscience and spoke
         approvingly of it, while completely misinterpreting the reflection of some
         green foliage on a shining table by congratulating Hunt on the moonlight
         effect. And then, in tones of disdain, his voice sometimes rising to a treble,
         he spoke at great length, discouraging interruption on The Light of the
         World:You call that thing, I ween, a picture of
         Jesus Christ. Now you cannot gain any profit to yourself, except in mere pecuniary sense, or
         profit any one else on earth, in putting into shape a mere papistical fantasy like that, for
         it can only be an inanity, or a delusion to every one that may look on it. It is a poor
         misshaped presentation of the noblest, the brotherliest, and the most heroic-minded Being
         that ever walked on God's earth. Do you ever suppose that Jesus walked about bedizened
         in priestly robes and a crown and with yon jewels on his breast, and a gilt aureole
         round His head? Ne'er crown nor pontifical robe did the world e'er give to such as Him.
         Well â€” and if you mean to represent Him as been travestied from the beginning by worldlings
         who have recorded their own ambitions as His, repeating Judas's betrayal to the high
         priests. You should think frankly of His antique heroic soul, if you realized His
         character at all you wouldn't try to make people go back and worship the image that the priests
         have invented of Him, to keep men's silly souls in meshes of slavery and darkness. Don't
         you see that you're helping to make people believe what you know to be false, what
         y' don't believe yourself? The picture I was looking at just now of the shallow idle fool
         and his wretched victim had to do with reality; this is only empty make-believe, mere
         pretended fancy, to do the like of which is the worst occupations for a man to take to.In vain did Hunt protest that he believed
         in the
         idea that he had painted and that he could prove from his, Carlyle's, writings
         that he did too. At this the sage's voice rose to a scream which Mrs.
         Carlyle, standing behind him, quelled by shaking her head and a finger. The
         storm of words continued unabated, it seemed, for nearly half an hour, and then
         the great flow of rhetoric ceased as suddenly as it had begun. Turning to go,
         Carlyle pointed to a drawing on the wall. 'And pray who may that shrewd
         looking man be with the domed and ample cranium? He ought to be a man of
         mark.' That, said Hunt, was his father, whom he 'regarded as a man of very
         exceptional intellect.'"
