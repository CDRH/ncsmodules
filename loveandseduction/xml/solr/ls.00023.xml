         A DEVOUT DEBAUCHER
         How a Nice young Christian Man Improved the Shining Hours of a Sunday School ConventionBY THE SEDUCTION
         Of a Fair Young Fellow-Member at the Hotel Where the Brethren and Sisters Put Up
         BUT, LIKE BEECHER, HE DENIESGreensburg, Ind., May 1 — Greensburg is enjoying another bit
         of scandal, the dimensions of which are alarming. It is a case of
         "nest-hiding," and the Elizabeth Tilton Beecher in it has confessed. The
         matter has not yet found its way into court, but it will probably reach there
         ere many days. By it the Christian Church is brought into notoriety, all
         parties interested being members of that organization, and also of "high-toned"
         society, the gentler party of the first part being no less a personage than
         Miss Hannah white, step-daughter of Mr. Samuel McLaughlin, one of the most
         highly-honored citizens of Decatur county. Miss White is a blooming maiden of
         twenty-one summers—old enough to know better—is a tall, handsome brunette,
         and has moved in Greenburg's best society, indeed has been regarded as a
         veritable belle.The sterner party to the questionable
         transaction, or at least the young man upon whom the responsibility threatens
         to rest, and who has already received an invitation to walk up to the
         clergyman's office—marriage license in hand—and settle, is a dashing young
         widower of about thirty-five years, Mr. Newton Hazelrigg, of the well-known
         carriage manufacturing firm of Crawford &amp; Hazelrigg.A few months since, say three or four, the
         family physician of McL. was called upon to attend Miss Hannah, her health
         being declared in a precarious condition. The Doctor pronounced the case one
         of "dropsy," and treated it accordingly, until about the first of last week.
         At that time it happened that a party was held at the residence of one of the
         brethren, and the ladies very naturally discussed the fortunes and misfortunes
         of their own sex. The conversation finally turning upon Miss White, one of the
         ladies remarked she "guessed the dropsy would soon fall into Hannah's arms."  This remark naturally impressed the Doctor's
         wife, and when
         she returned home she related to him what she had heard at the party. Availing
         himself of this information, he declared that he would immediately visit his patient
         and make an effort to extort from her the truth as to her condition.Putting the question squarely to Miss Hannah,
         she confessed that she was enceinte, had been since September last, and
         then related the history of her trouble. At the time the mischief was done,
         she says she was at Rushville, Ind., in company with other members of the
         Christian Church, in attendance upon a Sunday school convention — among the
         number the reputed father of the child. She says that he coaxed so hard to
         occupy the same room with her at the hotel that she finally consented, and the
         result was the casting of a shadow.The close proximity of the period when she
         should become a mother demanded that something should be done to save her from
         the disgrace that would inevitably attach to her. The reputed father, or
         rather the man whom Miss White designates as her room-mate at Rushville,
         Hazelrigg, was at Columbus, Ind., on business. Last week, a couple of friends
         of the family procured a carriage and went after him. The denouement made,
         he declared that it was the first intimation he had received of the condition
         of the young lady. Returning home with them on Saturday night he called at the
         McLaughlin residence, and found out "what was the matter with Hannah." He was
         convinced of the truth of what he had heard. The mother, keenly smarting under
         the development, sternly demanded that he should marry her daughter; that he
         was the author of her ruin, and was in honor bound to make all possible reparation.  He protested that he was not the father
         of the child; that
         others — one a married man—had also been guilty of too close an intimacy with
         Miss Hannah; that they had "put up a job" on him for the purpose of screening
         themselves. He said to your reporter to-day that he knew he could not be the
         father of the prospective child, and that he would fight to the bitter end any
         attempt to make him appear as such. He acknowledged that he was with Miss
         White at Rushville, and that like the characters in the Dickey-Tyrus drama,
         they had taken a pleasant ride in a carriage. He even went so far as to say
         that he knew beyond peradventure that Miss White had become familiarly
         acquainted with other young men in town as with himself, that indeed one of
         these young men had first intimated to him that Miss W. was not possessed of
         moral compunctions, and that through these very intimations and insinuations he
         had been led to seek a further acquaintance with the lady in question. It is
         alleged that inducements were offered in the shape of a house, furniture, and
         considerable cash, if Hazelrigg would marry the young lady; that he obstinately
         repelled their offers; and declared that if they attempted to force him by
         litigation he would make revelations that would cause "other hearts to ache." 
         He claims even that one or two other members of the church have also been
         guilty of the same indiscretion that he has.As yet the trouble has not appeared in court,
         nor have any preliminary papers been filed, but it is fair to suppose that the
         friends of the poor girl, occupying as they do a proud social position, will
         not suffer her misfortunes to go unrevenged. Some kind of redress will likely
         be sought. Of the 5,000 people in Greenville probably about 4,900 are
         discussing the merits of the case. It is, perhaps, proper to add that the
         fingers have all been counted in Greenburg, and it is said that on or about the
         5th of next month the trouble will culminate.
