      <field name="text">Scene Two: Adam confronts Arthur and Hetty in the groveAfter that pause, he strode on again along the broad winding path
         through the Grove. What grand beeches! Adam delighted in a fine
         tree of all things; as the fisherman's sight is keenest on the
         sea, so Adam's perceptions were more at home with trees than with
         other objects. He kept them in his memory, as a painter does,
         with all the flecks and knots in their bark, all the curves and
         angles of their boughs, and had often calculated the height and
         contents of a trunk to a nicety, as he stood looking at it. No
         wonder that, not-withstanding his desire to get on, he could not
         help pausing to look at a curious large beech which he had seen
         standing before him at a turning in the road, and convince himself
         that it was not two trees wedded together, but only one. For the
         rest of his life he remembered that moment when he was calmly
         examining the beech, as a man remembers his last glimpse of the
         home where his youth was passed, before the road turned, and he
         saw it no more. The beech stood at the last turning before the
         Grove ended in an archway of boughs that let in the eastern light;
         and as Adam stepped away from the tree to continue his walk, his
         eyes fell on two figures about twenty yards before him.He remained as motionless as a statue, and turned almost as pale. 
         The two figures were standing opposite to each other, with clasped
         hands about to part; and while they were bending to kiss, Gyp, who
         had been running among the brushwood, came out, caught sight of
         them, and gave a sharp bark. They separated with a start—one
         hurried through the gate out of the Grove, and the other, turning
         round, walked slowly, with a sort of saunter, towards Adam who
         still stood transfixed and pale, clutching tighter the stick with
         which he held the basket of tools over his shoulder, and looking
         at the approaching figure with eyes in which amazement was fast
         turning to fierceness.Arthur Donnithorne looked flushed and excited; he had tried to
         make unpleasant feelings more bearable by drinking a little more
         wine than usual at dinner to-day, and was still enough under its
         flattering influence to think more lightly of this unwished-for
         rencontre with Adam than he would otherwise have done. After all,
         Adam was the best person who could have happened to see him and
         Hetty together—he was a sensible fellow, and would not babble
         about it to other people. Arthur felt confident that he could
         laugh the thing off and explain it away. And so he sauntered
         forward with elaborate carelessness his flushed face, his evening
         dress of fine cloth and fine linen, his hands half-thrust into his
         waistcoat pockets, all shone upon by the strange evening light
         which the light clouds had caught up even to the zenith, and were
         now shedding down between the topmost branches above him.Adam was still motionless, looking at him as he came up. He
         understood it all now—the locket and everything else that had
         been doubtful to him: a terrible scorching light showed him the
         hidden letters that changed the meaning of the past. If he had
         moved a muscle, he must inevitably have sprung upon Arthur like a
         tiger; and in the conflicting emotions that filled those long
         moments, he had told himself that he would not give loose to
         passion, he would only speak the right thing. He stood as if
         petrified by an unseen force, but the force was his own strong
         will."Well, Adam," said Arthur, "you've been looking at the fine old
         beeches, eh? They're not to be come near by the hatchet, though;
         this is a sacred grove. I overtook pretty little Hetty Sorrel as
         I was coming to my den—the Hermitage, there. She ought not to
         come home this way so late. So I took care of her to the gate,
         and asked for a kiss for my pains. But I must get back now, for
         this road is confoundedly damp. Good-night, Adam. I shall see
         you to-morrow—to say good-bye, you know."Arthur was too much preoccupied with the part he was playing
         himself to be thoroughly aware of the expression in Adam's face. 
         He did not look directly at Adam, but glanced carelessly round at
         the trees and then lifted up one foot to look at the sole of his
         boot. He cared to say no more—he had thrown quite dust enough
         into honest Adam's eyes—and as he spoke the last words, he walked
         on."Stop a bit, sir," said Adam, in a hard peremptory voice, without
         turning round. "I've got a word to say to you."Arthur paused in surprise. Susceptible persons are more affected
         by a change of tone than by unexpected words, and Arthur had the
         susceptibility of a nature at once affectionate and vain. He was
         still more surprised when he saw that Adam had not moved, but
         stood with his back to him, as if summoning him to return. What
         did he mean? He was going to make a serious business of this
         affair. Arthur felt his temper rising. A patronising disposition
         always has its meaner side, and in the confusion of his irritation
         and alarm there entered the feeling that a man to whom he had
         shown so much favour as to Adam was not in a position to criticize
         his conduct. And yet he was dominated, as one who feels himself
         in the wrong always is, by the man whose good opinion he cares
         for. In spite of pride and temper, there was as much deprecation
         as anger in his voice when he said, "What do you mean, Adam?""I mean, sir"—answered Adam, in the same harsh voice, still
         without turning round—"I mean, sir, that you don't deceive me by
         your light words. This is not the first time you've met Hetty
         Sorrel in this grove, and this is not the first time you've kissed
         her."Arthur felt a startled uncertainty how far Adam was speaking from
         knowledge, and how far from mere inference. And this uncertainty,
         which prevented him from contriving a prudent answer, heightened his irritation. He said, in a high sharp tone, "Well, sir,
         what then?""Why, then, instead of acting like th' upright, honourable man
         we've all believed you to be, you've been acting the part of a
         selfish light-minded scoundrel. You know as well as I do what
         it's to lead to when a gentleman like you kisses and makes love to
         a young woman like Hetty, and gives her presents as she's
         frightened for other folks to see. And I say it again, you're
         acting the part of a selfish light-minded scoundrel though it cuts
         me to th' heart to say so, and I'd rather ha' lost my right hand.""Let me tell you, Adam," said Arthur, bridling his growing
         anger
         and trying to recur to his careless tone, "you're not only
         devilishly impertinent, but you're talking nonsense. Every pretty
         girl is not such a fool as you, to suppose that when a gentleman
         admires her beauty and pays her a little attention, he must mean
         something particular. Every man likes to flirt with a pretty
         girl, and every pretty girl likes to be flirted with. The wider
         the distance between them, the less harm there is, for then she's
         not likely to deceive herself.""I don't know what you mean by flirting," said Adam, "but if you
         mean behaving to a woman as if you loved her, and yet not loving
         her all the while, I say that's not th' action of an honest man,
         and what isn't honest does come t' harm. I'm not a fool, and
         you're not a fool, and you know better than what you're saying. 
         You know it couldn't be made public as you've behaved to Hetty as
         y' have done without her losing her character and bringing shame
         and trouble on her and her relations. What if you meant nothing
         by your kissing and your presents? Other folks won't believe as
         you've meant nothing; and don't tell me about her not deceiving
         herself. I tell you as you've filled her mind so with the thought of you as it'll mayhap poison her life, and she'll never
         love another man as 'ud make her a good husband."Arthur had felt a sudden relief while Adam was speaking; he
         perceived that Adam had no positive knowledge of the past, and
         that there was no irrevocable damage done by this evening's
         unfortunate rencontre. Adam could still be deceived. The candid
         Arthur had brought himself into a position in which successful
         lying was his only hope. The hope allayed his anger a little.
         "Well, Adam," he said, in a tone of friendly concession, "you're
         perhaps right. Perhaps I've gone a little too far in taking
         notice of the pretty little thing and stealing a kiss now and
         then. You're such a grave, steady fellow, you don't understand
         the temptation to such trifling. I'm sure I wouldn't bring any
         trouble or annoyance on her and the good Poysers on any account if
         I could help it. But I think you look a little too seriously at
         it. You know I'm going away immediately, so I shan't make any
         more mistakes of the kind. But let us say good-night"—Arthur
         here turned round to walk on—"and talk no more about the matter. 
         The whole thing will soon be forgotten.""No, by God!" Adam burst out with rage that could be controlled no
         longer, throwing down the basket of tools and striding forward
         till he was right in front of Arthur. All his jealousy and sense
         of personal injury, which he had been hitherto trying to keep
         under, had leaped up and mastered him. What man of us, in the
         first moments of a sharp agony, could ever feel that the fellow-man who has been the medium of inflicting it did not mean
         to hurt
         us? In our instinctive rebellion against pain, we are children
         again, and demand an active will to wreak our vengeance on. Adam
         at this moment could only feel that he had been robbed of Hetty—
         robbed treacherously by the man in whom he had trusted—and he
         stood close in front of Arthur, with fierce eyes glaring at him,
         with pale lips and clenched hands, the hard tones in which he had
         hitherto been constraining himself to express no more than a just
         indignation giving way to a deep agitated voice that seemed to
         shake him as he spoke."No, it'll not be soon forgot, as you've come in between her and
         me, when she might ha' loved me—it'll not soon be forgot as
         you've robbed me o' my happiness, while I thought you was my best
         friend, and a noble-minded man, as I was proud to work for. And
         you've been kissing her, and meaning nothing, have you? And I
         never kissed her i' my life—but I'd ha' worked hard for years for
         the right to kiss her. And you make light of it. You think
         little o' doing what may damage other folks, so as you get your
         bit o' trifling, as means nothing. I throw back your favours, for
         you're not the man I took you for. I'll never count you my friend
         any more. I'd rather you'd act as my enemy, and fight me where I
         stand—it's all th' amends you can make me."Poor Adam, possessed by rage that could find no other vent, began
         to throw off his coat and his cap, too blind with passion to
         notice the change that had taken place in Arthur while he was
         speaking. Arthur's lips were now as pale as Adam's; his heart was
         beating violently. The discovery that Adam loved Hetty was a
         shock which made him for the moment see himself in the light of
         Adam's indignation, and regard Adam's suffering as not merely a
         consequence, but an element of his error. The words of hatred and
         contempt—the first he had ever heard in his life—seemed like
         scorching missiles that were making ineffaceable scars on him. 
         All screening self-excuse, which rarely falls quite away while
         others respect us, forsook him for an instant, and he stood face
         to face with the first great irrevocable evil he had ever
         committed. He was only twenty-one, and three months ago—nay,
         much later—he had thought proudly that no man should ever be able
         to reproach him justly. His first impulse, if there had been time
         for it, would perhaps have been to utter words of propitiation;
         but Adam had no sooner thrown off his coat and cap than he became
         aware that Arthur was standing pale and motionless, with his hands
         still thrust in his waistcoat pockets."What!" he said, "won't you fight me like a man? You know I won't
         strike you while you stand so.""Go away, Adam," said Arthur, "I don't want to fight you.""No," said Adam, bitterly; "you don't
         want to fight me—you think
         I'm a common man, as you can injure without answering for it.""I never meant to injure you," said Arthur, with returning anger.
         "I didn't know you loved her.""But you've made her love you," said Adam. "You're a double-faced
         man—I'll never believe a word you say again.""Go away, I tell you," said Arthur, angrily, "or we shall both
         repent.""No," said Adam, with a convulsed voice, "I swear I won't go away
         without fighting you. Do you want provoking any more? I tell you
         you're a coward and a scoundrel, and I despise you."The colour had all rushed back to Arthur's face; in a moment his
         right hand was clenched, and dealt a blow like lightning, which
         sent Adam staggering backward. His blood was as thoroughly up as
         Adam's now, and the two men, forgetting the emotions that had gone
         before, fought with the instinctive fierceness of panthers in the
         deepening twilight darkened by the trees. The delicate-handed
         gentleman was a match for the workman in everything but strength,
         and Arthur's skill enabled him to protract the struggle for some
         long moments. But between unarmed men the battle is to the
         strong, where the strong is no blunderer, and Arthur must sink
         under a well-planted blow of Adam's as a steel rod is broken by an
         iron bar. The blow soon came, and Arthur fell, his head lying
         concealed in a tuft of fern, so that Adam could only discern his
         darkly clad body.He stood still in the dim light waiting for Arthur to rise.
         The blow had been given now, towards which he had been straining
         all the force of nerve and muscle—and what was the good of it?
         What had he done by fighting? Only satisfied his own passion,
         only wreaked his own vengeance. He had not rescued Hetty, nor changed the past—there it was, just as it had been, and he sickened
         at the vanity of his own rage.But why did not Arthur rise? He was perfectly motionless, and the
         time seemed long to Adam. Good God! had the blow been too much
         for him? Adam shuddered at the thought of his own strength, as
         with the oncoming of this dread he knelt down by Arthur's side and
         lifted his head from among the fern. There was no sign of life:
         the eyes and teeth were set. The horror that rushed over Adam
         completely mastered him, and forced upon him its own belief. He
         could feel nothing but that death was in Arthur's face, and that
         he was helpless before it. He made not a single movement, but
         knelt like an image of despair gazing at an image of death.
