         From Whom, Too, he has Learned to Swear That he Didn't.  When she Brings Against him a Charge ofRAPE AND OTHER INDISCRETIONSWaverly,
         O., June 4—The respectable inhabitants of Waverly
         and the neighboring village of Beavertown are considerably exercised over a
         case of scandal lately brought to light, the parties to which are members of
         prominent and respectable families. It is a case of bastardy and alleged rape,
         and the actors in it are Colonel T.W. Higgins, a prominent politician of this
         town, and Miss Mary Irons, daughter of Rev. Joseph Irons, of Beavertown.Colonel Higgins has been until within the last two
         weeks a member of the County Board for the Examination of Schools, and in that
         capacity a little over a year ago met Miss Irons, who was undergoing an
         examination for the position of teacher of the Wickline Township School. This was in April, 1877, at which time, owing to
         some defect, Miss Irons failed to
         obtain a certificate. On August 24th of the same year she alleged
         that Colonel Higgins came out to her father's house in Beavertown, and telling
         them he could get her a certificate, asked her to come to Waverly with him for
         that purpose. She agreed, and drove with him in a buggy.He had told her father he would take her to his own home,
         and that she could stay with his wife and daughters all night, and he would
         bring her back in the morning. Instead of this, when they arrived at Waverly,
         he affected to remember that there was company at his house and he could not
         take her there. So they went to the Emmit House, at that time kept by a lady
         named Cropper. Here he got a room for her and went out to get her certificate,
         as he promised. She states that she told the clerk when the Colonel came to
         send her words and she would come down in the parlor and receive him. Instead
         of doing this, she says that when the Colonel came back, about 9 o'clock in the
         evening, he crept up to her room without any one seeing him and entered the
         room before she had time to prevent him. He held the certificate in his hand
         and gave it to her to read; while doing so she alleges that he went to the
         window and closed the blinds, and when she asked him why he did so he laughed
         at it as a joke, and in the same playful manner blew out the light. He then,
         she says, caught hold of her and attempted to embrace her, at the same time
         making an indecent proposal to her. She resented this and struggled to get
         free. He overpowered her, however, and after quite a tussle threw her on the
         bed and accomplished his criminal purpose.  He staid in the room for a while and then went away.She says the reason she did
         not call for help was
         that she thought she could prevent him from succeeding in his design, and was
         afraid of what people would say when they found she was alone with him in a
         dark room. Afterward she claims she thought nothing would result from the act,
         and that it would be better not to publish her shame to the world. She says on
         the day following she was so weak and prostrated from the struggle that she had
         had with him and the effects of the outrage that she was hardly able to reach
         her home. She went to teach school, however, on the certificate given her by
         Higgins, and never informed any one of the affair until March last. When her
         condition became serious she informed her parents, telling them the whole
         story.Immediately on this her father sought out the
         Colonel and taxed him with it. The Colonel at first denied all knowledge of
         the matter according to her father's story, but afterward acknowledged having
         attempted the outrage, but claimed to have been unsuccessful.  Irons thereupon demanded that he resign his position, and
         though the Colonel demurred, he about two weeks ago consented, and handed his
         resignation to the board, and another man was appointed to the position. On
         Saturday last, however, Miss Irons swore out two warrants for his arrest, one
         charging him with rape and the other with bastardy. On the latter charge he
         was arrested this morning in Waverly by Constable Armintrout and taken to
         Beavertown, where he had a hearing this afternoon before Squire McAllister. He
         was accompanied by his counsel, Messrs. George D. Cole and H. James, and
         entered a plea of not guilty. Miss Irons was present with her father, and was
         also accompanied by counsel, Richard Dougherty, Esq.At the examination Miss Irons testified under
         oath to the main points of the statement given above, and as far as it
         concerned the case on trial, and the Squire held Colonel Higgins on bond of
         $500, the limit allowed by law, saying when asked, that if the law made it
         $10,000, he would be justified in making it that amount. The Colonel promptly
         furnished the bond. Mr. B. Adams, of Beavertown, going his security. The
         Colonel denies the whole of the charges.  He bases his principal proof on the fact that it was the 9th
         of August on which he took Miss Irons to Waverly, and got her a room at the Emmit
         House. He claims she has not yet become a mother, and she says she never was
         alone with him since. The length of time that has elapsed would make this
         charge preposterous. He does not deny taking her to the Emmit House, but he
         says all their transactions there were above board. His counsel to-day, in
         their cross-examination of Miss Irons, endeavored to place the paternity of the
         child on Mr. Isaac Wickline, a member of the Board of School Directors, at
         whose house Miss Irons boarded while teaching school. The latter denies
         emphatically having ever had intercourse with Mr. Wickline, who is engaged in
         business with her father, or with any other man, except on the occasion with Colonel Higgins.Colonel Higgins is a well-known
         politician here,
         and was Colonel of the Seventy-third Ohio Regiment during the war. He is about
         fifty years of age and married, having four children—one of whom, a daughter,
         a very estimable young lady, was married about three weeks ago to a respectable
         man in this place.Public opinion is much divided on the subject
         around here. The Waverly people mostly believe Higgins' story and the
         Beavertown folks that of Miss Irons. The Squire's bond holds Colonel Higgins
         for his appearance at the first term of court here on the 17th of
         June. The Colonel to-night expressed his determination to institute
         proceedings against Mr. Irons for blackmail, and against Miss Irons for
         perjury. He also proposes to institute proceedings against the Watchman, a
         journal published here, for criminal libel publishing the charge against him in
         to-day's issue.
