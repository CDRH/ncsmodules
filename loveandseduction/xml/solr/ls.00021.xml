      <field name="text">A CHEEKY CHICAGO-UNAmours of a Festive Railroad Man of O'Learyville, who Established his Legitimate HomeIN A QUIET LITTLE
         TOWNBut who had his Harems all Along the Line; and now his Admiring Neighbors Promise himA TAR AND FEATHER ULSTERHinsdale,
         Ill., May 14.—A domestic cyclone, bearing on its
         wave the secrets of a home and the shattered reputations of several frail but gushing
         and voluptuous females, has struck this little town, situated on the line of
         the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy railroad, and some eighteen miles west of
         Chicago. Its twelve or fourteen hundred staid, steady and God-fearing citizens stand
         bewildered at the lascivious doings of one of their number. The developments of
         the present case bring to the surface the loyalty of and fidelity of a prudent
         wife, and go to show the depths of suffering that sometimes lie hidden in the
         breast of a good woman, to be brought forth from its hiding-place only at the
         demand of public justice, and when it can no longer, be hidden from unsavory
         whisperings and disgusting comments. The prominent figure in the present
         scandal which has struck Hinsdale with the force of an earthquake is embodied
         in Henry L. Estabrooks, traveling auditor of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy railroad, with headquarters at Chicago. If
         the innumerable stories of this gentleman's
         escapades be true, there can be little doubt that the mantle of the late Mr.Young,
         with the proclivities of a Beecher ensconced in the folds of the garment, had
         fallen upon him. During this festive gentleman's eight years' residence in Hinsdale it is claimed that he has persistently
         and brutally violated his marriages vows.He did not, however, confine his operations to the shady
         suburb of Hinsdale, but covered a section of country bounded by the home
         residence and Lake Michigan, with a large section of country in and around Chicago yet to be heard from. As is natural to
         suppose, many of the residents of Hinsdale
         and those along the line of road leading to Chicago, strongly objected to this.
         After mature consideration about a year ago on the part of several of the
         citizens of the pleasant western suburb, it was deemed necessary, in the
         interest of morality, to request the gentleman to pack his grip-sack and locate
         in other fields. This conclusion was conveyed to the railroad man, but
         trusting in the protection of law-abiding citizens, he declined with thanks.
         The wife of the peculiarly constituted gentleman, an estimable lady, the mother
         of two children, and who is respected and loved by the citizens for her many
         excellent qualities, has recently separated from the husband, after many years
         of harsh and brutal treatment, it is said.Her application for a divorce is
         now in the hands of a well-known Chicago attorney, and will be vigorously
         prosecuted. It is claimed by the abused wife that for years she has been unable
         to retain a domestic in her employ, from the fact of the husband's propensity
         to chloroform her (the wife), and then devote the hours of her unconsciousness
         to the scullery maid. An instance of late date is related, where the wife
         visited her mother, in Chicago, and during her absence placed the home in
         charge of a domestic, engaged the day preceding her leaving. The wife, at the
         solicitation of the husband, remained from her home several days, during which
         time the girl says she was subjected to repeated attacks of an indecent
         character from Estabrooks. It is related by the domestic that he proposed
         marriage to her several times, but she declined to preside over his domestic
         affairs, as well as others of a seductive nature.His importunities gained strength and frequency from her
         every refusal. One night he was unusually demonstrative; he declared his
         undying, fierce, consuming love for her in the strongest terms, and, when she
         refused, he talked of shooting himself, and told her he could save his life and
         hers only by consenting to smile across the tea-table. She consented, for she had
         a fear of firearms, and the anticipations of the mangled corpse which should
         contain his heart, sort of froze her with terror. The railroad man was so
         jubilant over his success in this case that he couldn't or didn't avoid
         speaking of it. After a time the fact came to the ears of the domestic that he
         had spoken of his strong will, and how he had conquered her, and this so moved
         her that she gave the railroad man "dead away" to his wife and every scullery maid
         in Hinsdale. He tried, the girl states, to win her back, but she was
         inflexible. Then, as the last method he could think of, he resorted to letter
         writing, and succeeded in setting up a rather dramatic model for the literature
         of lovers. In his epistles to the girl he asks forgiveness for all the trouble he
         had caused her; assures her of forgiveness for all the trouble she has caused;
         rehearses his agony, which is unbearable; tells her that he would be out of it
         quick, only that he wanted to make his property over to parties who would protect
         it from the claims of his wife. In one of these letters to the servant the
         gentleman becomes tired of life, and proposes to blow out his brains, after which
         he asks her to remain in the village that morning so as to get the news early.
         He requests her to destroy his letters when he has passed away, and not forget
         to visit his last resting-place, and concludes with the assurance that he is "hers while life lasts."This was about the form
         adopted by the diplomatic railroad
         man in "working up the cases" of the several domestics who came into his
         household, and they, without an exception, have invariably "given him away,"
         not only to the abused and suffering wife, but have spread the fact among the
         domestics of the suburb, and they in turn have given the facts, highly
         embellished, no doubt, into higher circles, until the man has become loathed
         and abhorred by the entire community.Sometime during the early part of
         the present month Mrs. B. again visited her relations in Chicago. During her
         absence the recently-employed domestic was, as she says, subjected to such
         gross usage at the hands of Estabrooks that she was compelled to seek refuge in
         an adjoining residence, where she remained until Mrs. E.'s return, when the
         full facts were laid before her. The latest act of the man had become generally
         well known throughout the town, and the matter of his compulsory leaving the neighborhood
         or being subjected to an artistic coat of tar and feathers was freely
         discussed. As before, law and order prevailed. The residents of the town,
         without an exception, it is believed, have openly espoused the cause of the wronged
         wife in her application for a separation, and express a determination to make
         the gentleman "move out" at an early date.This cherub of a husband, it is
         related by the unfortunate woman, has repeatedly beaten her, and once, while
         pregnant, she was knocked down and kicked, until the neighbors came to her
         assistance and ejected him from the house. A daughter, ten years of age, has
         also been subjected to brutal punishment from the father. Estabrooks afterward
         justified these acts of brutality by the statement that he was a martyr, to the
         toothache. There are other acts charged against the husband and father equally
         damaging. For instance, it is asserted by the wife, and substantiated by those
         who had an opportunity of knowing the truthfulness of the assertion, that the
         wife and children were frequently compelled to submit to indecent exposures.  In addition to all this it is given as a notorious
         fact that
         the family of a harmless fellow placed in a subordinate position by Estabrooks,
         in one of the offices of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy railroad, has been
         debauched by the patron. The family resided at Western
         Springs for a couple of years, during which time the liaison between Estabrooks
         and the wife was openly conducted, and to such an extent as to be freely
         commented upon by the railroad employees and others who were daily observers of
         the shameful conduct of both parties. The conduct of the wife became so glaring
         that the husband finally applied for a divorce on the ground of the wife's
         adultery with Estabrooks. The divorce was granted, and the ex-wife, It is
         claimed, is now scratching a living on Wabash avenue, in the vicinity of Twelfth street.There is a scarlet woman, too, in
         the case, and she comes in the form of a seductive grass-widow, the relic of an
         ex-railroad official. She is a blonde, a pronounced one, and like Mr.
         Sparkler's various flames, this particular blonde has "no bigged nonsense about
         her."  When a wife comes in her path, and interferes with her prey, she strikes
         from the shoulder. Mr. Estabrooks, it is stated, has long been an ardent
         admirer of the voluptuous blonde, and has had her domiciled in his home at Hinsdale for several weeks in succession, against
         the repeated protests of his wife and
         children. The grass-widow has been in daily attendance at the offices of the Chicago and Burlington road in this city, and
         is well-known to the officials. The wife
         states that during a visit, in company with her little boy, to her husband's office
         in Chicago, this woman was found comfortably quartered in his embrace.  The incident is related by Mrs. Estabrooks in this
         way: On
         gaining the floor on which her husband's office was located, she stopped in the
         hall to converse with a lady acquaintance, while the child entered the office
         in search of his papa. The boy immediately returned with the request that his
         "mamma come quick." Mama did "come quick," and stopped quicker. A scene followed—one
         that developed from tragic prose to pallor and surprise with words of
         recrimination and worse."My husband, who is this?" gasped
         the wife. It was plain to any employee and railroad official who in
         immediately gathered in the vicinity of the auditor's department, who "this"
         was for it wore a look caught from the inner walls of a house of ill-fame; it
         had the stamp of the harlot upon it. When the clapper smote it brazen interior
         it gave forth its harsh sound with a prostitute's word and accent. The recreant
         lord clutched his desk and stood pale and angered for a few moments in the
         presence of his wife and child and a score or so of the railroad employees.Other instances of like character
         are quoted, and, the residents of Hinsdale are unanimous in the belief that a
         great injury has been perpetrated upon an estimable wife and mother, who has
         labored long to suppress the irregularities of an unworthy husband. And the end is not yet. Tar and
         feathers are nightly expected.
