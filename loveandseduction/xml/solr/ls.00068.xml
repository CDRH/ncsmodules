      <field name="text">Scene Two: Emma and Rodolphe's Love Scene in the WoodsAs soon as he felt the ground, Emma's horse set off at a gallop.
         Rodolphe galloped by her side. Now and then they exchanged a
         word. Her figure slightly bent, her hand well up, and her right
         arm stretched out, she gave herself up to the cadence of the
         movement that rocked her in her saddle.At the bottom of the hill Rodolphe gave his horse its head; they started together at
         a
         bound, then at the top suddenly the horses stopped, and her large
         blue veil fell about her.It was early in October. There was fog over the land. Hazy clouds
         hovered on the horizon between the outlines of the hills; others,
         rent asunder, floated up and disappeared. Sometimes through a
         rift in the clouds, beneath a ray of sunshine, gleamed from afar
         the roots of Yonville, with the gardens at the water's edge, the
         yards, the walls and the church steeple. Emma half closed her
         eyes to pick out her house, and never had this poor village where
         she lived appeared so small. From the height on which they were
         the whole valley seemed an immense pale lake sending off its
         vapour into the air. Clumps of trees here and there stood out
         like black rocks, and the tall lines of the poplars that rose
         above the mist were like a beach stirred by the wind.By the side, on the turf between the pines, a brown light
         shimmered in the warm atmosphere. The earth, ruddy like the
         powder of tobacco, deadened the noise of their steps, and with
         the edge of their shoes the horses as they walked kicked the
         fallen fir cones in front of them.Rodolphe and Emma thus went along the skirt of the wood. She
         turned away from time to time to avoid his look, and then she saw
         only the pine trunks in lines, whose monotonous succession made
         her a little giddy. The horses were panting; the leather of the
         saddles creaked.Just as they were entering the forest the sun shone out."God protects us!" said Rodolphe."Do you think so?"
         she said."Forward! forward!" he continued.He "tchk'd" with his tongue. The two beasts set off at a trot.Long ferns by the
         roadside caught in Emma's stirrup.
         Rodolphe leant forward and removed them as they rode along. At
         other times, to turn aside the branches, he passed close to her,
         and Emma felt his knee brushing against her leg. The sky was now
         blue, the leaves no longer stirred. There were spaces full of
         heather in flower, and plots of violets alternated with the
         confused patches of the trees that were grey, fawn, or golden
         coloured, according to the nature of their leaves. Often in the
         thicket was heard the fluttering of wings, or else the hoarse,
         soft cry of the ravens flying off amidst the oaks.They dismounted. Rodolphe fastened up the horses. She walked on
         in front on the moss between the paths. But her long habit got in
         her way, although she held it up by the skirt; and Rodolphe,
         walking behind her, saw between the black cloth and the black
         shoe the fineness of her white stocking, that seemed to him as if
         it were a part of her nakedness.She stopped. "I am tired," she said."Come, try again," he went on. "Courage!"Then some hundred
         paces farther on she again stopped, and through
         her veil, that fell sideways from her man's hat over her hips,
         her face appeared in a bluish transparency as if she were
         floating under azure waves."But where are we going?"He did not answer. She was breathing irregularly. Rodolphe looked
         round him biting his moustache. They came to a larger space where
         the coppice had been cut. They sat down on the trunk of a fallen
         tree, and Rodolphe began speaking to her of his love. He did not
         begin by frightening her with compliments. He was calm, serious,
         melancholy.Emma listened to him with bowed head, and stirred the bits of
         wood on the ground with the tip of her foot. But at the words,
         "Are not our destinies now one?""Oh, no!" she replied. "You know that well. It is impossible!"She rose to go. He seized her
         by the wrist. She stopped. Then,
         having gazed at him for a few moments with an amorous and humid
         look, she said hurriedly—"Ah! do not speak of it again! Where are the horses?  Let us go
         back."He made a gesture of anger and annoyance. She repeated:"Where are the horses?  Where are the horses?"Then smiling a
         strange smile, his pupil fixed, his teeth set, he
         advanced with outstretched arms. She recoiled trembling. She
         stammered:"Oh, you frighten me! You hurt me! Let me go!""If it must be," he went on, his face changing; and he again
         became respectful, caressing, timid. She gave him her arm. They
         went back. He said—"What was the matter with you?  Why?  I do not understand. You were
         mistaken, no doubt. In my soul you are as a Madonna on a
         pedestal, in a place lofty, secure, immaculate. But I need you to
         live! I must have your eyes, your voice, your thought! Be my
         friend, my sister, my angel!"And he put out his arm round her waist. She feebly tried to
         disengage herself. He supported her thus as they walked along.But they heard the two horses browsing on the leaves."Oh! one
         moment!" said Rodolphe. "Do not let us go! Stay!"He drew her farther on to a small pool where duckweeds made a
         greenness on the water. Faded water lilies lay motionless between
         the reeds. At the noise of their steps in the grass, frogs jumped
         away to hide themselves."I am wrong! I am wrong!" she said. "I am mad to listen to you!""Why?  Emma! Emma!""Oh, Rodolphe!"
         said the young woman slowly, leaning on his
         shoulder.The cloth of her habit caught against the velvet of his coat. She
         threw back her white neck, swelling with a sigh, and faltering,
         in tears, with a long shudder and hiding her face, she gave
         herself up to him—The shades of night were falling; the horizontal sun passing
         between the branches dazzled the eyes. Here and there around her,
         in the leaves or on the ground, trembled luminous patches, as if
         hummingbirds flying about had scattered their feathers. Silence
         was everywhere; something sweet seemed to come forth from the
         trees; she felt her heart, whose beating had begun again, and the
         blood coursing through her flesh like a stream of milk. Then far
         away, beyond the wood, on the other hills, she heard a vague
         prolonged cry, a voice which lingered, and in silence she heard
         it mingling like music with the last pulsations of her throbbing
         nerves. Rodolphe, a cigar between his lips, was mending with his
         penknife one of the two broken bridles.
