	<head>Liberty and Power the Objectives of Good Government</head>

	<p>If the two be compared in reference to the ends for which government is ordained, the superiority of the government of the concurrent majority will not be less striking.  These, as has been stated, are twofold:  to protect and to perfect society.  But to preserve society, it is necessary to guard the community against injustice, violence, and anarchy within, and against attacks from without.  If it fail in either, it would fail in the primary end of government and would not deserve the name.</p>
	<p>To perfect society, it is necessary to develop the faculties, intellectual and moral, with which man is endowed.  But the mainspring to their development and, through this, to progress, improvement, and civilization, with all their blessings, is the desire of individuals to better their condition.  For this purpose liberty and security are indispensable.  Liberty leaves each free to pursue the course he may deem best to promote his interest and happiness, as far as it may be compatible with the primary end for which government is ordained, while security gives assurance to each that he shall not be deprived of the fruits of his exertions to better his condition.  These combined give to this desire the strongest impulse of which it is susceptible.  For to extend liberty beyond the limits assigned would be to weaken the government and to render it incompetent to fulfill its primary end&#8212;the protection of society against dangers, internal and external.  The effect of this would be insecurity; and of insecurity, to weaken the impulse of individuals to better their condition and thereby retard the progress and improvement.  On the other hand, to extend the powers of the government so as to contract the sphere assigned to liberty would have the same effect, by disabling individuals in their efforts to better their condition.</p>
	<p>Herein is to be found the principle which assigns to power and liberty their proper spheres and reconciles each to the other under all circumstances.  For if power be necessary to secure to liberty the fruits of its exertions, liberty, in turn, repays power with interest&#8212;by increased population, wealth, and other advantages which progress and improvement bestow on the community.  By thus assigning to each its appropriate sphere, all conflicts between them cease, and each is made to cooperate with and assist the other in fulfilling the great ends for which government is ordained.</p>
	<p>But the principle, applied to different communities, will assign to them different limits.  It will assign a larger sphere to power and a more contracted one to liberty, or the reverse, according to circumstances.  To the former, there must ever be allotted, under all circumstances, a sphere sufficiently large to protect the community against danger from without and violence and anarchy within.  The residuum belongs to liberty.  More cannot be safely or rightly allotted to it.</p>
	<p>But some communities require a far greater amount of power than others to protect them against anarchy and external dangers; and, of course, the sphere of liberty in such must be proportionally contracted.  The causes calculated to enlarge the one and contract the other are numerous and various.  Some are physical&#8212;such as open and exposed frontiers surrounded by powerful and hostile neighbors.  Others are moral&#8212;such as the different degrees of intelligence, patriotism, and virtue among the mass of the community, and their experience and proficiency in the art of self-government.  A community may possess all the necessary moral qualifications in so high a degree as to be capable of self-government under the most adverse circumstances, while, on the other hand, another may be sunk in ignorance and vice as to be incapable of forming a conception of liberty or of living, even when most favored by circumstances, under any other than an absolute and depotic government.</p>
	<p>The principle in all communities, according to these numerous and various causes, assigns power and liberty their proper spheres.  To allow to liberty, in any case, a sphere of action more extended than this assigns would lead to anarchy, and this, probably, in the end to a contraction instead of an enlargement of its sphere.  Liberty, then, when forced on a people unfit for it, would instead of a blessing, be a curse, as it would in its reaction lead directly to anarchy&#8212;the greatest of all curses.  No people, indeed, can long enjoy more liberty than that to which their situation and advanced intelligence and morals fairly entail them.  If more than this be allowed, they must soon fall into confusion and disorder&#8212;to be followed, if not by anarchy and despotism, by a change to a form of government more simple and absolute, and therefore better suited to their condition.  And hence, although it may be true that people may not have as much liberty as they are fairly entitled to and are capable of enjoying, yet the reverse is unquestionably true&#8212;that no people can long possess more than they are fairly entitled to.</p>
	<p>Liberty, indeed, though among the greatest blessings, is not so great as that of protection, inasmuch as the end of the former is the progress and improvement of the race, while that of the latter is its preservation and perpetuation.  And hence, when the two come into conflict, liberty must, and ever ought, to yield to protection, as the existence of the race is of greater moment than its improvement.</p>
	<p>It follows, from what has been stated, that it is a great and dangerous error to suppose that all people are equally entitled to liberty.  It is a reward to be earned, not a blessing to be gratuitously lavished on all alike&#8212;a reward reserved for the intelligent, the patriotic, the virtuous and deserving, and not a boon to be bestowed on a people too ignorant, degraded, and vicious to be capable either of appreciating or of enjoying it.  Nor is it any disparagement to liberty that such is and ought to be the case.  On the contrary, its greatest praise&#8212;its proudest distinction is that an all-wise Providence has reserved it as the noblest and highest reward for the development of our faculties, moral and intellectual.  A reward more appropriate than liberty could not be conferred on the deserving, nor a punishment inflicted on the undeserving more just than to be subject to lawless and despotic rule.  This dispensation seems to be the result of some fixed law; and every effort to disturb or defeat it, by attempting to elevate a people in the scale of liberty above the point to which they are entitled to rise, must ever prove abortive and end in disappointment.  The progress of a people rising from a lower to a higher point in the scale of liberty is necessarily slow; and by attempting to precipitate, we either retard or permanently defeat it.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
	<head>Liberty and Equality</head>
	<p>There is another error, not less great and dangerous, usually associated with the one which has just been considered.  I refer to the opinion that liberty and equality are so intimately united that liberty cannot be perfect without perfect equality.</p>
	<p>That they are united to a certain extent, and that equality of citizens, in the eyes of the law, is essential to liberty in a equality of <hi rend="italic">condition</hi> essential to liberty would be to destroy both liberty and progress.  The reason is that inequality of condition, while it is a necessary consequence of liberty, is at the same time indispensable to progress.  In order to understand why this is so, it is necessary to bear in mind that the mainspring of progress is the desire of individuals to better their condition, and that the strongest impulse which can be given to it is to leave individuals free to exert themselves in the manner they may deem best for that purpose, as far at least as it can be done consistently with the ends for which government is ordained, and to secure to all the fruits of their exertions.  Now, as individuals differ greatly from each other in intelligence, sagacity, energy, perserverance, skill, habits of industry and economy, physical power, position and opportunity&#8212;the necessary effect of leaving all free to exert themselves to better their condition must be a corresponding inequality between those who may possess these qualities and advantages in a high degree and those who may be deficient in them.  The only means by which this result can be prevented are either to impose such restrictions on the exertions of those who may possess them in a high degree as will place them on a level with those who do not, or to deprive them of the fruits of their exertions.  But to impose such restrictions on them would be destructive to liberty, while to deprive them of the fruits of their exertions would be to destroy the desire of bettering their condition.  It is, indeed, this inequality of condition between the front and rear ranks, in the march of progress, which gives so strong an impulse to the former to maintain their position, and to the latter to press forward into their files.  This gives to progress its greatest impulse.  To force the front rank back to the rear or attempt to push forward the rear into line with the front, by the interposition of the government, would put an end to the impulse and effectually arrest the march of progress.</p>
