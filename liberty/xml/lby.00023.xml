<head type="main">From <hi rend="italic">Make Way for Liberty!</hi></head>
<head type="sub">[Battle of Sempach, July 9, 1386.]</head>

<lg>
<l>"Make way for Liberty!"&#8212;he cried;</l>
<l>Make way for Liberty, and died!</l>
<l>In arms the Austrian phalanx stood,</l>
<l>A living wall, a human wood!</l>
<l>A wall, where every conscious stone</l>
<l>Seemed to its kindred thousands grown;</l>
<l>A rampart all assaults to bear,</l>
<l>Till time to dust their frames should wear;</l>
<l>A wood like that enchanted grove</l>
<l>In which with fiends Rinaldo strove . . .</l>
<l>So dense, so still, the Austrians stood,</l>
<l>A living wall, a human wood! . . .</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Opposed to these, a hovering band</l>
<l>Contended for their native land:</l>
<l>Peasants, whose new-found strength had broke</l>
<l>From manly necks the ignoble yoke,</l>
<l>And forged their fetters into swords,</l>
<l>On equal terms to fight their lords,</l>
<l>And what insurgent rage he gained</l>
<l>In many a mortal fray maintained:</l>
<l>Marshalled once more at Freedom's call,</l>
<l>They came to conquer or to fall,</l>
<l>Where he who conquered, he who fell,</l>
<l>Was deemed a dead, or living, Tell!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>And now the work of life and death</l>
<l>Hung on the passing of a breath;</l>
<l>The fire of conflict burned within,</l>
<l>The battle trembled to begin:</l>
<l>Yet, while the Austrians held their ground,</l>
<l>Point for attack was nowhere found;</l>
<l>Where'er the impatient Switzers gazed,</l>
<l>The unbroken line of lances blazed:</l>
<l>That line 't were suicide to meet,</l>
<l>And perish at their tyrants' feet,&#8212;</l>
<l>How could they rest within their graves,</l>
<l>And leave their homes the homes of slaves?</l>
<l>Would they not feel their children tread</l>
<l>With clanging chains above their head?</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>It must not be: this day, this hour,</l>
<l>Annihilates the oppressor's power;</l>
<l>All Switzerland is in the field,</l>
<l>She will not fly, she cannot yield,&#8212;</l>
<l>She must not fall; her better fate</l>
<l>Here gives her an immortal date.</l>
<l>Few were the numbers she could boast;</l>
<l>But every freeman was a host,</l>
<l>And felt as though himself were he</l>
<l>On whose sole arm hung victory.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>It did depend on <hi rend="italic">one</hi> indeed;</l>
<l>Behold him,&#8212;Arnold Winkelried!</l>
<l>There sounds not to the trump of fame</l>
<l>The echo of a nobler name.</l>
<l>"Make way for Liberty!" he cried,</l>
<l>Then ran, with arms extended wide,</l>
<l>As if his dearest friend to clasp;</l>
<l>Ten spears he swept within his grasp.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>"Make way for Liberty!" he cried;</l>
<l>Their keen points met from side to side;</l>
<l>He bowed amongst them like a tree,</l>
<l>And thus made way for Liberty.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Swift to the breach his comrades fly;</l>
<l>"Make way for Liberty!" they cry,</l>
<l>And through the Austrian phalanx dart,</l>
<l>As rushed the spears through Arnold's heart;</l>
<l>While, instantaneous as his fall,</l>
<l>Rout, ruin, panic, scattered all:</l>
<l>An earthquake could not overthrow</l>
<l>A city with a surer blow.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Thus Switzerland again was free;</l>
<l>Thus Death made way for Liberty!</l>
</lg>
