	<l>Let the nation weep,</l>

	<l>To his last, long sleep!</l>

	<lg type="stanza">
	<l>Ay, let the nation weep!</l>
	<l>Another such as he</l>

	<lg type="stanza">
	<l>Ay, let the nation weep,</l>
	<l>And let the slow bells toll</l>
	<l>For the noblest soul</l>
	<l>That ever dwelt in man,</l>
	<l>Or ever led the van</l>
	<l>Of Freedom's hosts to victory,</l>
	<l>And rang the charge of Liberty.</l>
	</lg>
	<lg type="stanza">
	<l>Well may the nation weep</l>
	<l>And shudder at the stroke</l>
	<l>That all their slumbering wrath awoke.</l>
	<l>What wretch so impious as to dare</l>
	<l>To smite the leader of the people's choice,</l>
	<l>Or seek to harm a single hair</l>
	<l>Of him whose heart, whose hand, whose voice,</l>
	<l>Were all employed to work the nation's good,</l>
	<l>And stop the flow of fratricidal blood?</l>
	<l>Perchance he did not seem</l>
	<l>So great to those who deem</l>
	<l>A traitor or a Nero</l>
	<l>May still appear a hero,</l>
	<l>If he but wear a classic face</l>
	<l>Or ape the superficial grace</l>
	<l>That marks the scion of a titled race;</l>
	<l>Not such was he for whom we mourn;</l>
	<l>From wealth or rank he was not born,</l>
	<l>Nor heir to patrimonial lands</l>
	<l>Tilled by the bondman's weary hands;</l>
	<l>His was the celestial beauty</l>
	<l>Of a soul that does its duty;</l>
	<l>Noble patriot, husband, father,</l>
	<l>He did not strive to gather</l>
	<l>The laurels of a wild ambition,</l>
	<l>That only yield a vain fruition.</l>
	<l>To benefit mankind&#8212;this was his aim,</l>
	<l>To labor and to live unstained with blame&#8212;</l>
	<l>He died without a blot upon his name.</l>
	<l>Let all the weary and oppressed,</l>
	<l>From North and South and East and West,</l>
	<l>For whom his great heart yearned,</l>
	<l>For whom his spirit burned,</l>
	<l>To give the sufferings rest,</l>
	<l>Let all arise with lamentation,</l>
	<l>And with his own beloved nation</l>
	<l>Bequeath the fame</l>
	<l>Of Lincoln's name&#8212;</l>
	<l>A heritage of veneration&#8212;</l>
	<l>To the remotest generation.</l>
	</lg>
	<lg type="stanza">
	<l>Ay, let the nation weep,</l>
	<l>While the slow bells toll,</l>
	<l>And the cannon roll</l>
	<l>For the funeral knoll</l>
	<l>Of his mighty soul!</l>
	<l>Ye cannot break the slumber deep</l>
	<l>That wraps his limbs in quiet sleep;</l>
	<l>He cannot hear</l>
	<l>The crowds that tread</l>
	<l>Around his bier,</l>
	<l>Nor see the tears they shed;</l>
	<l>For he nevermore shall dwell</l>
	<l>Among the people that he loved so well;</l>
	<l>Let the nation's sorrow have its way</l>
	<l>For him who was the nation's stay.</l>
	</lg>
	<lg type="stanza">
	<l>Our hearts are sad, our eyes are dim;</l>
	<l>We hoped long years of rest for him,</l>
	<l>To enjoy the peace for which he wrought,</l>
	<l>The peace with his own life-blood bought.</l>
	<l>But he has rest,</l>
	<l>Among the blest,</l>
	<l>And with the Christ he loved.</l>
	<l>Enough&#8212;his work was done,</l>
	<l>The victor's crown was won,</l>
	<l>And God himself removed</l>
	<l>The patriot-martyr to his home.</l>
	<l>Enough&#8212;his task was done;</l>
	<l>For us remains to guard his tomb;</l>
	<l>To bid the willow wave</l>
	<l>Around the sacred grave</l>
	<l>Of him who loosed the slave,</l>
	<l>And weave the fame</l>
	<l>Of Lincoln's name</l>
	<l>With that of Washington;</l>
	<l>While kingdoms crumble, old and hoary,</l>
	<l>In a world where all is transitory,</l>
	<l>They shall ever shine, twin stars of glory,</l>
	<l>With undimmed splendor, in our nation's story.</l>

	<lg type="stanza">
	<l>While swells the unusual wail,</l>
	<l>In heart-gusts, o'er the murdered man,</l>
	<l>His life, my wounded soul, unveil,</l>
	<l>His entrance and his exit scan;</l>
	<l>For as in Timnath Samson drew</l>
	<l>Sweets from the noble lion dead,</l>
	<l>So may a living soul renew</l>
	<l>Its vigor from the martyr's bed.</l>
	</lg>
	<lg type="stanza">
	<l>Dimly within the western woods,</l>
	<l>Where Indiana smiles, we see</l>
	<l>A peasant boy, whose thoughtful moods</l>
	<l>Still bear him onward hopefully</l>
	<l>With heart benevolent and blythe,</l>
	<l>Which aches but at another's pain,</l>
	<l>He wields the axe, the hoe, the scythe,</l>
	<l>Singing the glad songs of freedom's reign.</l>
	</lg>
	<lg type="stanza">
	<l>And when to manhood grown, fall taught,</l>
	<l>By rushing flood and winged wind,</l>
	<l>What freedom meant, one holy thought</l>
	<l>Ruled paramount within his mind.</l>
	<l>That thought was&#8212;justice to the slave,</l>
	<l>Leading to words and acts sublime,</l>
	<l>And musings how he yet might save</l>
	<l>His country from her shameful crime.</l>
	</lg>
	<lg type="stanza">
	<l>At length a statesman, rough, but true,</l>
	<l>Anon Columbia's chosen chief,</l>
	<l>He stands, and in the world's broad view</l>
	<l>Declares his purpose, firm and brief.</l>
	<l>The hour of trial hastens fast&#8212;</l>
	<l>Rebellion's roar, and battle's shock;</l>
	<l>He meets the suffocating blast,</l>
	<l>And stands unmoved, a granite rock.</l>
	</lg>
	<lg type="stanza">
	<l>Seven crimson seasons o'er him roll,</l>
	<l>And treason, rampant, stands at bay;</l>
	<l>But with a calm, unshrinking soul,</l>
	<l>In heaven he trusts, and leads the way.</l>
	<l>In patriarchal tones he speaks,</l>
	<l>And from a million swarthy limbs</l>
	<l>The chains fall off&#8212;oppression shrieks&#8212;</l>
	<l>And liberty sings glorious hymns.</l>
	</lg>
	<lg type="stanza">
	<l>And as the bellowing strife prevails,</l>
	<l>The star-led world looks on amazed;</l>
	<l>But right, oft baffled, never quails,</l>
	<l>The rebel crew reel backward, crazed.</l>
	<l>And in the dust their banner lies,</l>
	<l>Trampled and torn&#8212;no more to shame</l>
	<l>The light of the eternal skies</l>
	<l>With slavery's accursed name.</l>
	</lg>
	<lg type="stanza">
	<l>His country's saved, his work achieved,</l>
	<l>He boasted not of what he'd done,</l>
	<l>But rather, in his goodness grieved</l>
	<l>For all sad hearts beneath the sun.</l>
	<l>For even his most malignant foes,</l>
	<l>Blind perverts! whom he sought to save</l>
	<l>From ruin's toppling crash; their woes</l>
	<l>He pitied, and their faults forgave.</l>
	</lg>
	<lg type="stanza">
	<l>And now his genial spirits seek</l>
	<l>Their wonted channel&#8212;war's fierce rage</l>
	<l>Had surged against his pallid cheek,</l>
	<l>And multiplied the signs of age.</l>
	<l>A moment's respite from the storm,</l>
	<l>A little rest from goading care,</l>
	<l>His people fain to see his form</l>
	<l>Where mirth and music thrill the air.</l>
	</lg>
	<lg type="stanza">
	<l>Beside him smiles his loving wife,</l>
	<l>Leaning upon the honored man</l>
	<l>Whose life to her is more than life,</l>
	<l>Who feels as only woman can.</l>
	<l>Guileless himself, he could not think</l>
	<l>That treason's foulest whelp had power</l>
	<l>To push him off from earth's dim brink</l>
	<l>In such a place, at such an hour.</l>
	</lg>
	<lg type="stanza">
	<l>Behind him glares the demon eye,</l>
	<l>Behind him moves the demon hand,</l>
	<l>A quick, sharp sound&#8212;a start, a cry!</l>
	<l>Then gleams aloft the hellish brand.</l>
	<l>'Tis done! his venerable head</l>
	<l>Sinks peacefully&#8212;his soul departs;</l>
	<l>The honest President is dead,</l>
	<l>And with him die all human hearts.</l>
	</lg>
	<lg type="stanza">
	<l>Go, student of the vanished years,</l>
	<l>Compare the democratic sage,</l>
	<l>Whose exit leaves the world in tears,</l>
	<l>With the crowned sons of every age.</l>
	<l>His humble birth with theirs compare,</l>
	<l>His labor 'gainst their leisure weigh;</l>
	<l>Mark well how, shunning every snare,</l>
	<l>He kept the straight and narrow way.</l>
	</lg>
	<lg type="stanza">
	<l>Draw thence this lesson&#8212;honest worth,</l>
	<l>That brightens more the more 'tis tried,</l>
	<l>Will triumph yet o'er all the earth,</l>
	<l>And take the place of pomp and pride.</l>
	<l>And also&#8212;the assassin's hand</l>
	<l>May smite the body, not the truth</l>
	<l>That in the body bears command&#8212;</l>
	<l>For virtue wears immortal youth.</l>

	<l>Athwart the troubled waters swiftly sailing</l>

	<l>Around its path the wandering winds were wailing,</l>
	<l>And white around it flashed the angry spray.</l>
	<l>Alas! it flitted o'er a troubled ocean</l>
	<l>Where withering winds swept wildly as it past,</l>
	<l>And urged it onward with unquiet motion,</l>

	<lg type="stanza">
	<l>'Twas but the emblem of the swiftly gliding</l>

	<l>Thou too wert battling with the tempest's power:</l>
