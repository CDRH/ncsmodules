      <field name="text">WHY I AM A LIBERALContributed to a volume edited by Andrew Reid, in which a number of leaders of English thought answered
         the question, "Why I am a Liberal?""WHY?" Because all I haply can and do,All that I am now, all I hope to be,—Whence comes
         it save from fortune setting freeBody and soul the purpose to pursue,God traced for both? If fetters, not a few,Of prejudice,
         convention, fall from me,These shall I bid men—each in his degreeAlso God-guided—bear, and gayly, too?But little do or can
         the best of us:That little is achieved through Liberty.Who, then, dares hold, emancipated thus,His fellow shall continue bound?
         Not I,Who live, love, labor freely, nor discussA brother's right to freedom. That is"Why."
