      <field name="text">From Make Way for Liberty![Battle of Sempach, July 9, 1386.]"Make way for Liberty!"—he cried;Make way for Liberty, and died!In
         arms the Austrian phalanx stood,A living wall, a human wood!A wall, where every conscious stoneSeemed to its kindred thousands
         grown;A rampart all assaults to bear,Till time to dust their frames should wear;A wood like that enchanted groveIn which with
         fiends Rinaldo strove . . .So dense, so still, the Austrians stood,A living wall, a human wood! . . .Opposed to these, a hovering
         bandContended for their native land:Peasants, whose new-found strength had brokeFrom manly necks the ignoble yoke,And forged
         their fetters into swords,On equal terms to fight their lords,And what insurgent rage he gainedIn many a mortal fray maintained:Marshalled
         once more at Freedom's call,They came to conquer or to fall,Where he who conquered, he who fell,Was deemed a dead, or living,
         Tell!And now the work of life and deathHung on the passing of a breath;The fire of conflict burned within,The battle trembled
         to begin:Yet, while the Austrians held their ground,Point for attack was nowhere found;Where'er the impatient Switzers gazed,The
         unbroken line of lances blazed:That line 't were suicide to meet,And perish at their tyrants' feet,—How could they rest within
         their graves,And leave their homes the homes of slaves?Would they not feel their children treadWith clanging chains above
         their head?It must not be: this day, this hour,Annihilates the oppressor's power;All Switzerland is in the field,She will
         not fly, she cannot yield,—She must not fall; her better fateHere gives her an immortal date.Few were the numbers she could
         boast;But every freeman was a host,And felt as though himself were heOn whose sole arm hung victory.It did depend on one indeed;Behold
         him,—Arnold Winkelried!There sounds not to the trump of fameThe echo of a nobler name."Make way for Liberty!" he cried,Then
         ran, with arms extended wide,As if his dearest friend to clasp;Ten spears he swept within his grasp."Make way for Liberty!"
         he cried;Their keen points met from side to side;He bowed amongst them like a tree,And thus made way for Liberty.Swift to
         the breach his comrades fly;"Make way for Liberty!" they cry,And through the Austrian phalanx dart,As rushed the spears through
         Arnold's heart;While, instantaneous as his fall,Rout, ruin, panic, scattered all:An earthquake could not overthrowA city with
         a surer blow.Thus Switzerland again was free;Thus Death made way for Liberty!
