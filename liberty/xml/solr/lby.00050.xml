      <field name="text">Remember Americans, that we must and shall be free, and enlightened as you are, will you wait until we shall, under God, obtain
         our liberty by the crushing arm of power?  Will it not be dreadful for you?  I speak Americans for your good.  We must and
         shall be free I say, in spite of you...Throw away your fears and prejudices then, and enlighten us and treat us like men,
         and we will like you more than we do now hate you, and tell us no more about colonization, for America is as much our country,
         as yours.  Treat us like men, and there is no danger but we will all live in peace and happiness together.  For we are not
         like you, hard hearted, unmerciful and unforgiving.  What a happy country this will be, if the whites will listen.  What nation
         under heaven, will be able to do anything with us, unless God gives us up into his hand?  But Americans, I declare to you,
         while you keep us in bondage, and treat us like brutes, to make us support you and your families, we cannot be your friends.
         You do not look for it, do you?  Treat us then like men, and we will be your friends. (Lowance 142-43)
