      <field name="text">BOOK THE THIRD. THE TRACK OF A STORM.CHAPTER I.IN SECRET.THE traveller fared slowly on his way, who fared towards Paris from
         England in the autumn of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two. More than enough of bad roads, bad equipages,
         and bad horses he would have encountered to delay him, though the fallen and unfortunate King of France had been upon his
         throne in all his glory; but, the changed times were fraught with other obstacles than these. Every town gate and village
         taxing-house had its band of citizen-patriots, with their national muskets in a most explosive state of readiness, who stopped
         all comers and goers, cross-questioned them, inspected their papers, looked for their names in lists of their own, turned
         them back, or sent them on, or stopped them and laid them in hold, as their capricious judgement or fancy deemed best for
         the dawning Republic One and Indivisible, of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death.A very few French leagues of his journey
         were accomplished, when Charles Darnay began to perceive that for him along these country roads there was no hope of return
         until he should have been declared a good citizen at Paris. Whatever might befall now, he must on to his journey's end. Not
         a mean village closed upon him, not a common barrier dropped across the road behind him, but he knew it to be another iron
         door in the series that was barred between him and England. The universal watchfulness so encompassed him, that if he had
         been taken in a net, or were being forwarded to his destination in a cage, he could not have felt his freedom more completely
         gone.
