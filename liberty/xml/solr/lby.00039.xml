      <field name="text">The Liberty Bell—The Liberty Bell,The tocsin of Freedom and Slavery's knellThat a whole long year has idle hung,Again is waggin
         its clamorous tongue!As it merrily swings,Its notes it flingsOn the dreamy ear of the planters and kings,And it gives them
         a token,Of manacles broken;—And all that the prophets of Freedom have spoken.With tongues of flame,(Like those which cameOn
         the men who first spoke the Saviour's name,)Comes over their soulAs death-bells knowl,Or the wheels of coming thunder roll!Our
         Liberty Bell—They know it well,The tocsin of Freedom and Slavery's knell!The Liberty Bell is hung aloft,On the transatlantic
         shore;And we hear its echoes, oft and oft,Wafted the waters o'er;And welcomed shall those echoes be!Music of Liberty!Liberty
         for the white—the few—From the oppressor's thrall?Nay! but Liberty,—Liberty, too,For the blacks,—for all!Slavery shall not
         stamp her banOn any men,—or manSee! there are flowers of every shadeOver earth's bosom spread;All by the same Great Artist
         made,By the same bounty fed;Brightened by sunshine, freshened by showers,All those beautiful flowers.So in the heavens, but
         differing, farDiffering, in glory and might;But glorious every one, star by starRolls in the car of night;All outpouring,—all,
         in their turns,—Light from their golden urns.Flowers and stars,—in heaven, on earth,—The feeblest as the first,The impress
         bears of a glorious birth,And is in glory nurst;And is led onward gloriously,Through its varied destiny.Despised there is
         none—degraded none;Each holds its ordered place;But 't is man—usurping man, alone,Who hath stigmatized his race;Who hath giv'n
         his fellow—O shame! O shame!A slave's ignoble name!But, the heavenly elements, which mould,In man, God's effigy,—They were
         never meant to be controlledTo a slave's destiny;Nor shall they long;—for the slave shall beAs the free-born—aye, as free!Come,
         then, that bright and benignant time,When LIBERTY'S blessed BELL,All earth re-echoing it, shall chimeSlavery's final knell;And
         Slavery's dreary tales be toldAs a mythic page of old!
