      <field name="text">ODE TO LIBERTY.Yet, Freedom, yet they banner torn but flying,Streams like a thunder-storm against the wind.BYRON.A GLORIOUS
         people vibrated againThe lightning of the nations: LibertyFrom heart to heart, from tower to tower, oer Spain,Scattering contagious
         fire into the sky,Gleamed. My soul spurned the chains of its dismay,And, in the rapid plumes of song,Clothed itself, sublime
         and strong;As a young eagle soars the morning clouds among,Hovering in verse oer its accustomed prey;Till from its station
         in the Heaven of fameThe Spirits whirlwind rapped it, and the rayOf the remotest sphere of living flameWhich paves the void,
         was from behind it flung,As foam from a ships swiftness, when there cameA voice out of the deep: I will record the same.The
         Sun and the serenest Moon sprang forth:The burning stars of the abyss were hurl'dInto the depths of Heaven. The dædal earth,That
         island in the ocean of the world,Hung in its cloud of all-sustaining air:But this divinest universeWas yet a chaos and a curse,For
         thou wert not: but, power from worst producing worse,The spirit of the beasts was kindled there,And of the birds, and of the
         watery forms,And there was war among them, and despairWithin them, raging without truce or terms:The bosom of their violated
         nurseGroaned, for beasts warred on beasts, and worms on worms,And men on men; each heart was as a hell of storms.Man, the
         imperial shape, then multipliedHis generations under the pavilionOf the Suns throne: palace and pyramid,Temple and prison,
         to many a swarming millionWere, as to mountain-wolves their ragged caves.This human living multitudeWas savage, cunning, blind,
         and rude,For thou wert not; but oer the populous solitude,Like one fierce cloud over a waste of waves,Hung Tyranny; beneath,
         sate deifiedThe sister-pest, congregator of slaves;Into the shadow of her pinions wide,Anarchs and priests who feed on gold
         and blood,Till with the stain their inmost souls are dyed,Drove the astonished herds of men from every side.The nodding promontories,
         and blue isles,And cloud-like mountains, and dividuous wavesOf Greece, basked glorious in the open smilesOf favouring Heaven:
         from their enchanted cavesProphetic echoes flung dim melodyOn the unapprehensive wild.The vine, the corn, the olive mildGrew
         savage yet, to human use unreconciled;And, like unfolded flowers beneath the sea,Like the mans thought dark in the infants
         brain,Like aught that is which wraps what is to be,Arts deathless dreams lay veiled by many a veinOf Parian stone; and, yet
         a speechless child,Verse murmured, and Philosophy did strainHer lidless eyes for thee; when oer the Ægean mainAthens arose:
         a city such as visionBuilds from the purple crags and silver towersOf battlemented cloud, as in derisionOf kingliest masonry:
         the ocean-floorsPave it; the evening sky pavilions it;Its portals are inhabitedBy thunder-zoned winds, each headWithin its
         cloudy wings with sun-fire garlanded,A divine work! Athens diviner yetGleamed with its crest of columns, on the willOf man,
         as on a mount of diamond, set;For thou wert, and thine all-creative skillPeopled with forms that mock the eternal deadIn marble
         immortality, that hillWhich was thine earliest throne and latest oracle.Within the surface of Times fleeting riverIts wrinkled
         image lies, as then it layImmoveably unquiet, and for everIt trembles, but it cannot pass away!The voices of thy bards and
         sages thunderWith an earth-awakening blastThrough the caverns of the past;Religion veils her eyes; Oppression shrinks aghast:A
         winged sound of joy, and love, and wonder,Which soars where Expectation never flew,Rending the veil of space and time asunder!One
         ocean feeds the clouds, and streams, and dew;One sun illumines heaven; one spirit vastWith life and love makes chaos ever
         new,As Athens doth the world with thy delight renew.Then Rome was, and from thy deep bosom fairest,Like a wolf-cub from a
         Cadmæan Mænad,She drew the milk of greatness, though thy dearestFrom that Elysian food was yet unweaned;And many a deed of
         terrible uprightnessBy thy sweet love was sanctified;And in thy smile, and by thy side,Saintly Camillus lived, and firm Atilius
         died.But when tears stained thy robe of vestal whiteness,And gold profaned thy Capitolian throne,Thou didst desert, with spirit-winged
         lightness,The senate of the tyrants: they sunk proneSlaves of one tyrant: Palatinus sighedFaint echoes of Ionian song; that
         toneThou didst delay to hear, lamenting to disown.From what Hyrcanian glen or frozen hill,Or piny promontory of the Arctic
         main,Or utmost islet inaccessible,Didst thou lament the ruin of thy reign,Teaching the woods and waves, and desert rocks,And
         every Naiads ice-cold urn,To talk in echoes sad and sternOf that sublimest lore which man had dared unlearn?For neither didst
         thou watch the wizard flocksOf the Scalds dreams, nor haunt the Druids sleep.What if the tears rained through thy shattered
         locks,Were quickly dried? for thou didst groan, not weep,When from its sea of death to kill and burn,The Galilean serpent
         forth did creep,And made thy world an undistinguishable heap.A thousand years the Earth cried, Where art thou?And then the
         shadow of thy coming fellOn Saxon Alfreds olive-cinctured brow:And many a warrior-peopled citadel.Like rocks which fire lifts
         out of the flat deep,Arose in sacred Italy,Frowning oer the tempestuous seaOf kings, and priests, and slaves, in tower-crowned
         majesty;That multitudinous anarchy did sweep,And burst around their walls, like idle foam,Whilst from the human spirits deepest
         deep,Strange melody with love and awe struck dumbDissonant arms; and Art, which cannot die,With divine want traced on our
         earthly homeFit imagery to pave Heavens everlasting dome.Thou huntress swifter than the Moon! thou terrorOf the worlds wolves!
         thou bearer of the quiver,Whose sunlike shafts pierce tempest-winged Error,As light may pierce the clouds when they disseverIn
         the calm regions of the orient day!Luther caught thy wakening glance;Like lightning, from his leaden lanceReflected, it dissolved
         the visions of the tranceIn which, as in a tomb, the nations lay;And Englands prophets hailed thee as their queen,In songs
         whose music cannot pass away,Though it must flow forever: not unseenBefore the spirit-sighted countenanceOf Milton didst thou
         pass, from the sad sceneBeyond whose night he saw, with a dejected mien.The eager hours and unreluctant yearsAs on a dawn-illumined
         mountain stood,Trampling to silence their loud hopes and fears,Darkening each other with their multitude,And cried aloud,
         Liberty! IndignationAnswered Pity from her cave;Death grew pale within the grave,And desolation howled to the destroyer, Save!When
         like heavens sun, girt by the exhalationOf its own glorious light, thou didst arise,Chasing thy foes from nation unto nationLike
         shadows: as if day had cloven the skiesAt dreaming midnight oer the western wave,Men started, staggering with a glad surprise,Under
         the lightnings of thine unfamiliar eyes.Thou Heaven of earth! what spells could pall thee then,In ominous eclipse? A thousand
         years,Bred from the slime of deep oppressions den,Dyed all thy liquid light with blood and tears,Till thy sweet stars could
         weep the stain away;How like Bacchanals of bloodRound France, the ghastly vintage, stoodDestructions sceptred slaves, and
         Follys mitred brood!When one, like them, but mightier far than they,The Anarch of thine own bewildered powersRose: armies
         mingled in obscure array,Like clouds with clouds, darkening the sacred bowersOf serene Heaven. He, by the past pursued,Rests
         with those dead, but unforgotten hours,Whose ghosts scare victor kings in their ancestral towers.England yet sleeps: was she
         not called of old?Spain calls her now, as with its thrilling thunderVesuvius wakens Ætna, and the coldSnow-crags by its reply
         are cloven in sunder:Oer the lit waves every Æolian isleFrom Pithecusa to PelorusHowls, and leaps, and glares in chorus:They
         cry, Be dim, ye lamps of Heaven suspended oer us.Her chains are threads of gold, she need but smileAnd they dissolve; but
         Spains were links of steel,Till bit to dust by virtues keenest file.Twins of a single destiny! appealTo the eternal years
         enthroned before usIn the dim West; impress us from a seal,All ye have thought and done! Time cannot dare conceal.Tomb of
         Arminius! render up thy dead,Till, like a standard from a watch-towers staff,His soul may stream over the tyrants head!Thy
         victory shall be his epitaph,Wild Bacchanal of truths mysterious wine,King-deluded Germany,His dead spirit lives in thee.Why
         do we fear or hope? thou art already free!And thou, lost Paradise of this divineAnd glorious world! thou flowery wilderness!Thou
         island of eternity! thou shrineWhere desolation, clothed with loveliness,Worships the thing thou wert! O Italy,Gather thy
         blood into thy heart; repressThe beasts who make their dens thy sacred palaces.Oh, that the free would stamp the impious nameOf
         **** into the dust! or write it there,So that this blot upon the page of fameWere as a serpents path, which the light airErases,
         and the flat sands close behind!Ye the oracle have heard:Lift the victory-flashing sword.And cut the snaky knots of this foul
         gordian word,Which, weak itself as stubble, yet can bindInto a mass, irrefragably firm,The axes and the rods which awe mankind;The
         sound has poison in it, tis the spermOf what makes life foul, cankerous, and abhorred;Disdain not thou, at thine appointed
         term,To set thine armed heel on this reluctant worm.O, that the wise from their bright minds would kindleSuch lamps within
         the dome of this dim world,That the pale name of PRIEST might shrink and dwindleInto the hell from which it first was hurled,A
         scoff of impious pride from fiends impure;Till human thoughts might kneel alone,Each before the judgement-throneOf its own
         aweless soul, or of the Power unknown!O, that the words which make the thoughts obscureFrom which they spring, as clouds of
         glimmering dewFrom a white lake blot Heavens blue portraiture,Were stripped of their thin masks and various hue,And frowns
         and smiles and splendours not their own,Till in the nakedness of false and trueThey stand before their Lord, each to receive
         its due.He who taught man to vanquish whatsoeverCan be between the cradle and the graveCrowned him the King of Life. Oh, vain
         endeavour!If on his own high will a willing slave,He has enthroned the oppression and the oppressor.What if earth can clothe
         and feedAmplest millions at their need,And power in thought be as the tree within the seed?Or what if Art, an ardent intercessor,Driving
         on fiery wings to Natures throne,Checks the great mother stooping to caress her,And cries: Give me, thy child, dominionOver
         all height and depth? if Life can breedNew wants, and wealth from those who toil and groan,Rend of thy gifts and hers a thousandfold
         for one!Come Thou, but lead out of the inmost caveOf mans deep spirit, as the morning-starBeckons the Sun from the Eoan wave,Wisdom.
         I hear the pennons of her carSelf-moving, like cloud charioted by flame;Comes she not, and come ye not,Rulers of eternal thought,To
         judge with solemn truth, lifes ill-apportioned lot?Blind Love, and equal Justice, and the FameOf what has been, the Hope of
         what will be?O Liberty! if such could be thy nameWert thou disjoined from these, or they from thee:If thine or theirs were
         treasures to be boughtBy blood or tears, have not the wise and freeWept tears, and blood like tears? The solemn harmonyPaused,
         and the Spirit of that mighty singingTo its abyss was suddenly withdrawn;Then as a wild swan, when sublimely wingingIts path
         athwart the thunder-smoke of dawn,Sinks headlong through the aerial golden lightOn the heavy sounding plain,When the bolt
         has pierced its brain;As summer clouds dissolve, unburthened of their rain;As a far taper fades with fading night,As a brief
         insect dies with dying day,My song, its pinions disarrayed of might,Drooped; oer it closed the echoes far awayOf the great
         voice which did its flight sustain,As waves which lately paved his watery wayHiss round a drowners head in their tempestuous
         play.
