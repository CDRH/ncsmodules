      <field name="text">TO WORDSWORTH.POET of Nature, thou hast wept to knowThat things depart which never may return;Childhood and youth, friendship
         and love's first glow,Have fled like sweet dreams, leaving three to mourn.These common woes I feel. One loss is mine,Which
         thou too feel'st; yet I alone deplore.Thou wert as a lone star, whose light did shineOn some frail bark in winter's midnight
         roar:Thou hast like to a rock-built refuge stoodAbove the blind and battling multitude;In honoured poverty thy voice did weaveSongs
         consecrate to truth and liberty,â€”Deserting these, thou leavest me to grieve,Thus having been, that thou shouldst cease to
         be.
