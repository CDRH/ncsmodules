      <field name="text">LIBERTYWhat man is there so bold that he should say,Thus, and thus only, would I have the Sea ?For whether lying calm and
         beautiful,Clasping the earth in love, and throwing backThe smile of Heaven from waves of amethyst;Or whether, freshened by
         the busy winds,It bears the trade and navies of the worldTo ends of use or stern activity;Or whether, lashed by tempests,
         it gives wayTo elemental fury, howls and roarsAt all its rocky barriers, in wild lustOf ruin drinks the blood of living things,And
         strews its wrecks oer leagues of desolate shore,â€”Always it is the Sea, and men bow downBefore its vast and varied majesty.So
         all in vain will timorous ones essayTo set the metes and bounds of Liberty.For Freedom is its own eternal law:It makes its
         own conditions, and in stormOr calm alike fulfils the unerring Will.Let us not then despise it when it liesStill as a sleeping
         lion, while a swarmOf gnat-like evils hover round its head;Nor doubt it when in mad, disjointed timesIt shakes the torch of
         terror, and its cryShrills oer the quaking earth, and in the flameOf riot and war we see its awful formRise by the scaffold,
         where the crimson axeRings down its grooves the knell of shuddering kings.For ever in thine eyes, O Liberty,Shines that high
         light whereby the world is saved,And though thou slay us, we will trust in thee!
