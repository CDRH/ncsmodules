      <field name="text">CHAPTER XI.CORRESPONDENCE."Base is the slave that pays."—ANCIENT PISTOL."DOTANDCARRYONETOWN, &amp;c.
         "DEAR MISS,—Mr Touchandgo will have told you of our arrival here, of our setting up a bank, and so forth. We came here in
         a tilted waggon, which served us for parlour, kitchen, and all. We soon got up a log-house; and, unluckily, we as soon got
         it down again, for the first fire we made in it burned down house and all. However, our second experiment was more fortunate;
         and we are pretty well lodged in a house of three rooms on a floor; I should say the floor, for there is but one."This new
         state is free to hold slaves; all the new states have not this privilege: Mr Touchandgo has brought some, and they are building
         him a villa. Mr Touchandgo is in a thriving way, but he is not happy here: he longs for parties and concerts, and a seat in
         congress. He thinks it very hard that he cannot buy one with his own coinage, as he used to do in England. Besides, he is
         afraid of the regulators, who, if they do not like a man's character, wait upon him and flog him, doubling the dose at stated
         intervals, till he takes himself off. He does not like this stystem of administering justice: though I think he has nothing
         to fear from it. He has the character of having money, which is the best of all characters here, as at home. He lets his old
         English prejudices influence his opinions of his new neighbours; but I assure you they have many virtues. Though they do keep
         slaves, they are all ready to fight for their own liberty; and I should not like to be an enemy within reach of one of their
         rifles. When I say enemy, I include bailiff in the term. One was shot not long ago. There was a trial; the jury gave two dollars
         damages; the judge said they must find guilty or not guilty; but the counsel for the defendant (they would not call him prisoner),
         offered to fight the judge upon the point: and as this was said literally, not metaphorically, and the counsel was a stout
         fellow, the judge gave in. The two dollars damages were not paid after all; for the defendant challenged the foreman to box
         for double or quits, and the foreman was beaten. The folks in New York made a great outcry about it, but here it was considered
         all as it should be. So you see, Miss, justice, liberty, and every thing else of that kind, are different in different places,
         just as suits the convenience of those who have the sword in their own hands. Hoping to hear of your health and happiness,
         I remain,
         "Dear Miss, your dutiful servant,
         "RODERICK ROBTHETILL."
