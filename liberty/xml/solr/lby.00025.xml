      <field name="text">The Eternal Female groand! it was heard over all the Earth:Albions coast is sick silent; the American meadows faint!Shadows
         of Prophecy shiver along by the lakes and the rivers and mutter across the ocean?  France rend down thy dungeon;Golden Spain
         burst the barriers of old Rome;Cast thy keys O Rome into the deep down falling, even to eteernity down falling,And weepIn
         her trembling hands she took the new born terror howling:On those infinite mountains of light now barr'd out by the atlantic
         sea, the new born fire stood before the starry king!Flag'd with grey brow'd snows and thunderous visages the jealous wings
         wav'd over the deep.The speary hand burned aloft, unbuckled was the shield, forth went the hand of jealousy among the flaming
         hair, and hurl'd the new born wonder thro' the starry night.The fire, the fire, is falling!Look up! look up! O citizen of
         London enlarge thy countenance; O Jew, leave counting gold! return to thy oil and wine; O African! black African! (go winged
         thought widen his forehead.)The fiery limbs, the flaming hair, shot like the sinking sun into the western sea.Wak'd from his
         eternal sleep, the hoary element roaring fled away:Down rushd beating wings in vain the jealous king; his grey brow'd councellors,
         thunderous warriors, curl'd veterans, among helms, and shields, and chariots[,] horses, elephants:  banners, castles, slings
         and rocks,Falling, rushing, ruining! buried in the ruins, on Urthona's dens.All night beneath the ruins, then their sullen
         flames faded emerge round the gloomy king,With thunder and fire: leading his starry hosts thro' the waste wilderness he promulgates
         his ten commands, glancing his beamy eyelids over the deep in dark dismay,Where the son of fire in his eastern cloud, while
         the morning plumes her golden breast.Spurning the clouds written with curses stamps the stony law to dust, loosing the eternal
         horses from the dens of night, cryingEmpire is no more! and now the lion &amp; wolf shall cease
