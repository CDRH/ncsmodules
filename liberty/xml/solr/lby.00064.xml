      <field name="text">Address of the Liberty Party of Pennsylvania to the People of the StateFriends and Fellow Citizens.At a Convention of Delegates
         of the Liberty Party of the Eastern section of Pennsylvania, held in Philadelphia, Feb. 22, 1844, the undersigned was made
         the chairman of a committee appointed to address you upon the great cause which we are laboring to promote. We now, therefore,
         proceed to set before you our views, our principles, and our aims; to state the means by which we believe those aims will
         be accomplished; and to invite your cordial and earnest co-operation with us, to secure such results as, we are sure, will
         be for the best good both of our State and of our country.PRINCIPLES OF THE PARTY.In the first place, then, we would state,
         that the Liberty Party, though new in its organization, is not new in its principles. It is, in the great elements of its
         character, only an old party revived. It is, in its principles, the same party as that which, in 1776, rallied around the
         Declaration of Independence, and "pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor," to maintain the noble sentiments
         avowed in that instrument, that "all men are created equal, and are endowed by their Creator with the unalienable rights of
         life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."  It is, in its principles, the same party as that which, in 1787, formed our
         own federal Constitution, the great object of which, as set forth in the preamble, is "to establish justice—to promote the
         general welfare—and to secure the blessings of liberty.'' It is, in its principles, the same party that, in the same year,
         in the Congress of the old Confederation, passed, unanimously, that ever-to-be-honoured Ordinance, in which it is declared
         that the whole territory of our country North and West of the river Ohio, should never be trodden by the foot of a slave.Such,
         fellow citizens, are the principles of our party. We cherish the same views as Washington, who wrote these very words,—"There
         is but one effectual mode by which the abolition of slavery can be accomplished, and that is by legislative authority, and
         this, so far as my SUFFRAGE will go, SHALL NOT BE WANTING." We cherish the same views as Patrick Henry, who declared ''that
         we owe it to the purity of our religion, to show that it is at variance with that law which warrants slavery."  We cherish
         the same views as Robert Morris, who, in the Convention for forming the Constitution, pronounced slavery to be ''a nefarious
         institution.'' We cherish the same views as William Pinckney, who said in the House of Delegates of Maryland, in 1789, "By
         the eternal principles of natural justice, no master in this state has a right to hold his slave for a single hour.'' We cherish
         the same views as Jefferson, who uttered these memorable words, ''I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just,
         and that his justice cannot sleep forever."  We cherish the same views as Dr. Rush, who declared slavery to be "repugnant
         to the principles of Christianity, and rebellion against the authority of a common Father." And we cherish the same views
         as Madison, who said, in the Convention of 1787, that it was "wrong to admit into the Constitution even the idea that there
         could be property in man."Yes, fellow citizens, these men of former days, and many more that might be named, saw and felt
         the evils of slavery. They saw that it must be a curse to any country; and they saw the great inconsistency of cherishing
         it in our own. They too, that if they themselves had any right, in 1776, to resist unto blood for a pound of tea, the slave
         had an infinitely higher right to make the same resistance for an infinitely higher object. This, one of these patriot spirits
         had the candour to express, declaring "that in such a contest the Almighty had no attributes which could take sides with the
         master." The men of those days looked forward, confidently, to the speedy extinction of slavery. In the Conventions of several
         of the States that met to ratify the Constitution, the opinions were unequivocally expressed. In the Convention of Massachusetts
         Judge Dawes remarked, that "slavery had received its death-wound, and would die of consumption." In the Convention of Pennsylvania,
         Judge Wilson, himself one of the framers of the Constitution, said, "The new States which are to be formed will be under the
         control of Congress, in this particular, AND SLAVERY WILL NEVER BE INTRODUCED AMONG THEM." And that great man, whose illustrious
         example can never be too often held up to us for imitation—General Washington—wrote to John Sinclair, "The abolition of slavery
         must take place, and that too at a period NOT REMOTE."Such, fellow citizens, were the opinions of the men who laid the foundations
         of our republic; men of high, noble, wide-reaching views; and who feared that nothing would so endanger the permanency of
         the fair fabric which their wisdom had reared, as the continuation of slavery. Far different, indeed, felt and spoke and wrote
         those men, from many of our modern, so-called statesmen:  far different from the Calhouns and the Mefluffies, who declare
         "slavery to be the corner-stone of our republican institutions:" far different from Henry Clay, who has proclaimed, unblushingly,
         that he is opposed to 
         any emancipation, immediate or gradual;" and who pronounced the opinion of Madison, "that man cannot hold property in man,"
         to be a "visionary dogma:" far different from Martin Van Buren, who pledged himself before election to veto any bill that
         Congress might pass to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia: and far different from many other prominent men of our
         times, whose highest ambition, we feel constrained to say, seems to be, to cringe to the slave power.The Address of the Southern
         and Western Liberty Convention Held at CincinnatiWith what party, then, shall we act? Or shall we act with none? Act, in some
         way, we must: 
         possession of the right of suffrage, the right of electing our own law-makers and rulers, imposes us the corresponding duty
         of voting for men who will carry out the views which we deem of  paramount importance and obligation. Act together 
         we must; for upon the questions which we regard most vital we are fully agreed. We must act then; act together; and act against
         slavery and oppression. Acting thus, we necessarily act as a party; for what is a party, but a body of citizens, acting together
         politically, in good faith, upon common principles, for a common object? And there be a party already in existence, animated
         by the same motives, and aiming at the same results as ourselves, we must act with and in that party.THAT there is such a
         party is well known. It is the Liberty party of the United States. Its principles, measures, and objects we cordially approve.
         It founds itself upon the great cardinal principle of true Democracy and of true Christianity, the brotherhood of the Human
         Family. It avows its purpose to wage implacable war against slaveholding as the direst form of oppression, and then against
         every other species of tyranny and injustice. Its views on the subject of slavery in this country are, in the main, the same
         as those which we have set forth in this address. Its members agree to regard the extinction of slavery as the most important
         end which can, at this time, be proposed to political action; and they agree to differ as to other questions of minor importance,
         such as those of trade and currency, believing that these can be satisfactorily disposed of, when the question of slavery
         shall be settled, and that, until then, they cannot he satisfactorily disposed of at all.The rise of such a party as this
         was anticipated long before its actual organization, by the single-hearted and patriotic Charles Follen, a German by birth,
         but a true American by adoption and in spirit. " If there ever is to be in this country," he said in 1836, ''a party that
         shall take its name and character, not from particular liberal measures or popular men, but from its uncompromising and consistent
         adherence to freedom—a truly liberal and thoroughly republican party, it must direct its first decided effort against the
         grossest form, the most complete manifestation of oppression ,and, having taken anti-slavery ground, it must carry out the
         principle of Liberty in all its consequences. It must support every measure conducive to the greatest possible individual
         and social, moral, intellectual, religious, and political freedom, whether that measure be brought forward by inconsistent
         slaveholders or consistent freemen. It must embrace the whole sphere of human action; watching and opposing the slightest
         illiberal and anti-republican tendency, and concentrating its whole force and influence against slavery itself, in comparison
         with which every other species of tyranny is tolerable, and by which every other is strengthened and justified."Thus wrote
         Charles Follen in 1836. It is impossible to express better the want which enlightened lovers of liberty felt of a real Democratic
         party in the country—Democratic not in name only, but in deed and in truth, In this want, thus felt, the Liberty party had
         its origin, and so long as this want remains otherwise unsatisfied, the Liberty party must exist; not as a mere Abolition
         party, but as a truly Democratic party, which aims at the extinction of slavery, because slaveholding is inconsistent with
         Democratic principles; aims at it, not as an ultimate end, but as the most important present object; as a great and necessary
         step in the work of reform; as an illustrious era in the advancement of society, to be wrought out by its action and instrumentality.
         The Liberty party of 1845 is, in truth, the Liberty party of 1776 revived. It is more: It is the party of Advancement and
         Freedom, which has, in every age, and with varying success, fought the battles of Human Liberty, against the party of False
         Conservatism and Slavery.
