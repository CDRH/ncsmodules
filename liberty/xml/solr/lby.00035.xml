      <field name="text">When I was about thirteen years old, and had succeeded in learning to read, every increase of knowledge, especially respecting
         the FREE STATES, added something to the almost intolerable burden of the thought—"I AM A SLAVE FOR LIFE."  To my bondage I
         saw no end.  It was a terrible reality, and I shall never be able to tell how sadly that thought chafed my young spirit. 
         Fortunately, or unfortunately, about this time in my life, I had made enough money to buy what was then a very popular school
         book, viz: the "Columbian Orator."  I bought this addition to my library, of Mr. Knight, on Thames street, Fell's Point, Baltimore,
         and paid him fifty cents for it.  I was first led to buy this book, by hearing some little boys say that they were going to
         learn some little pieces out of it for the Exhibition.  This volume was, indeed, a rich treasure, and every opportunity afforded
         me, for a time, was spent in diligently perusing it.  Among much other interesting matter, that which I had perused and reperused
         with unflagging satisfaction, was a short dialogue between a master and his slave.  The slave is represented as having been
         recaptured, in a second attempt to run away; and the master opens the dialogue with an upbraiding speech, charging the slave
         with ingratitude, and demanding to know what he has to say in his own defense.  Thus upbraided, and thus called upon to reply,
         the slave rejoins, that he knows how little anything that he can say will avail, seeing that he is completely in the hands
         of his owner; and with noble resolution, calmly says, "I submit to my fate."  Touched by the slave's answer, the master insists
         upon his further speaking, and recapitulates the many acts of kindness which he has performed toward the slave, and tells
         him he is permitted to speak for himself.  Thus invited to the debate, the quondam slave made a spirited defense of himself,
         and thereafter the whole argument, for and against slavery, was brought out.  The master was vanquished at every turn in the
         argument; and seeing himself to be thus vanquished, he generously and meekly emancipates the slave, with his best wishes for
         his prosperity.  It is scarcely necessary to say, that a dialogue, with such an origin, and such an ending—read when the fact
         of my being a slave was a constant burden of grief—powerfully affected me; and I could not help feeling that the day might
         come, when the well-directed answers made by the slave to the master, in this instance, would find their counterpart in myself.This,
         however, was not all the fanaticism which I found in this Columbian Orator.  I met there one of Sheridan's mighty speeches,
         on the subject of Catholic Emancipation, Lord Chatham's speech on the American war, and speeches by the great William Pitt
         and by Fox.  These were all choice documents to me, and I read them, over and over again, with an interest that was ever increasing,
         because it was ever gaining in intelligence; for the more I read them, the better I understood them.  The reading of these
         speeches added much to my limited stock of language, and enabled me to give tongue to many interesting thoughts, which had
         frequently flashed through my soul, and died away for want of utterance.  The mighty power and heart-searching directness
         of truth, penetrating even the heart of a slaveholder, compelling him to yield up his earthly interests to the claims of eternal
         justice, were finely illustrated in the dialogue, just referred to; and from the speeches of Sheridan, I got a bold and powerful
         denunciation of oppression, and a most brilliant vindication of the rights of man.  Here was, indeed, a noble acquisition.
         If I ever wavered under the consideration, that the Almighty, in some way, ordained slavery, and willed my enslavement for
         his own glory, I wavered no longer.  I had now penetrated the secret of all slavery and oppression, and had ascertained their
         true foundation to be in the pride, the power and the avarice of man.  The dialogue and the speeches were all redolent of
         the principles of liberty, and poured floods of light on the nature and character of slavery.  With a book of this kind in
         my hand, my own human nature, and the facts of my experience, to help me, I was equal to a contest with the religious advocates
         of slavery, whether among the whites or among the colored people, for blindness, in this matter, is not confined to the former.
         I have met many religious colored people, at the south, who are under the delusion that God requires them to submit to slavery,
         and to wear their chains with meekness and humility.  I could entertain no such nonsense as this; and I almost lost my patience
         when I found any colored man weak enough to believe such stuff.  Nevertheless, the increase of knowledge was attended with
         bitter, as well as sweet results.  The more I read, the more I was led to abhor and detest slavery, and my enslavers.  "Slaveholders,"
         thought I, "are only a band of successful robbers, who left their homes and went into Africa for the purpose of stealing and
         reducing my people to slavery."  I loathed them as the meanest and the most wicked of men.  As I read, behold! the very discontent
         so graphically predicted by Master Hugh, had already come upon me.  I was no longer the light-hearted, gleesome boy, full
         of mirth and play, as when I landed first at Baltimore.  Knowledge had come; light had penetrated the moral dungeon where
         I dwelt; and, behold! there lay the bloody whip, for my back, and here was the iron chain; and my good, kind master, he was
         the author of my situation.  The revelation haunted me, stung me, and made me gloomy and miserable.  As I writhed under the
         sting and torment of this knowledge, I almost envied my fellow slaves their stupid contentment.  This knowledge opened my
         eyes to the horrible pit, and revealed the teeth of the frightful dragon that was ready to pounce upon me, but it opened no
         way for my escape.  I have often wished myself a beast, or a bird—anything, rather than a slave.  I was wretched and gloomy,
         beyond my ability to describe.  I was too thoughtful to be happy.  It was this everlasting thinking which distressed and tormented
         me; and yet there was no getting rid of the subject of my thoughts.  All nature was redolent of it.  Once awakened by the
         silver trump of knowledge, my spirit was roused to eternal wakefulness.  Liberty! the inestimable birthright of every man,
         had, for me, converted every object into an asserter of this great right.  It was heard in every sound, and beheld in every
         object.  It was ever present, to torment me with a sense of my wretched condition.  The more beautiful and charming were the
         smiles of nature, the more horrible and desolate was my condition.  I saw nothing without seeing it, and I heard nothing without
         hearing it.  I do not exaggerate, when I say, that it looked from every star, smiled in every calm, breathed in every wind,
         and moved in every storm.
