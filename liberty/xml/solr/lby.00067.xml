      <field name="text">....It is a national calamity, that we endure men to rule over us, who sanction for whatever ends a conspiracy which is to
         arrive at its purpose through such a frightful pouring forth of human blood and agony.  But when that purpose is to trample
         upon our rights and liberties for ever, to present to us the alternatives of anarchy and oppression, and triumph when the
         astonished nation accepts the latter at their hands, to maintain a vast standing army, and add, year by year to a public debt,
         which, already, they know, cannot be discharged; and which, when the delusion that supports it fails, will produce as much
         misery and confusion through all classes of society as it has continued to produce of famine and degradation to the undefended
         poor; to imprison and caluminate those who may offend them, at will; when this, if not the purpose, is the effect of that
         conspiracy, how ought we not to mourn?
