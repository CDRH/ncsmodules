      <field name="text">Fellow citizens, I am not wanting in respect for the fathers of this republic.  The signers of the Declaration of Independence
         were brave men.  They were great men, too—great enough to give frame to a great age.  It does not often happen to a nation
         to raise, at one time, such a number of truly great men...They were statesmen, patriots, and heroes, and for the good they
         did, and the principles they contended for, I will unite with you to honor their memory. They loved their country better than
         their own private interests; and, though this is not the highest form of human excellence, all will concede that it is a rare
         virtue, and that when it is exhibited it ought to command respect...They were peace men; but they preferred revolution to
         peaceful submission to bondage.  They were quiet men; but they did not shrink from agitation against oppression.  They showed
         forbearance; but they knew its limits.  They believed in order; but not in the order of tyranny.  With them, nothing was settled
         that was not right.  With them, justice, liberty and humanity were "final"; not slavery and oppression.  You may well cherish
         the memory of such men.  They were great in their day and generation.  Their solid manhood stands out the more as we contrast
         it with these degenerate times...Would to God, both for your sakes and ours, that an affirmative answer could be truthfully
         returned to these questions!...But such is not the state of the case.  I say it with a sad sense of the disparity between
         us.  I am not included within the pale of this glorious anniversary!  Your high independence only reveals the immeasurable
         distance between us.  The blessings in which you, this day, rejoice, are not enjoyed in common.  The rich inheritance of justice,
         liberty, prosperity, and independence, bequeathed by your fathers, is shared by you, not by me.  The sunlight that brought
         light and healing to you, has brought stripes and death to me.  This Fourth of July is yours, not mine.  You may rejoice,
         I must mourn.  To drag a man in fetters into the grand illuminated temple of liberty, and call upon him to join you in joyous
         anthems, were inhuman mockery and sacrilegious irony.  Do you mean, citizens, to mock me, by asking me to speak today?  If
         so, there is a parallel to your conduct.  And let me warn you that it is dangerous to copy the example of a nation whose crimes,
         towering up to heaven, were thrown down by the breath of the Almighty, burying the nation in irrecoverable ruin!  I can today
         take up the plaintive lament of a peeled and woe-smitten people.  "By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down.  Yea!  We
         Wept in the midst thereof.  For there, they that carried us away captive, required of us a song; songs of Zion.  How can we
         sing the Lord's song in a strange land?  If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning.  If I do not
         remember these, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth." (Psalm 137.1-6)...Would you have me argue the wrongfulness
         of slavery?  Is that a question for Republicans?...How should I look today, in the presence of Americans, dividing, and subdividing
         a discourse, to show that men have a natural right to freedom?...(Lowance 40-41)What, to the American slave, is your Fourth
         of July?  I answer:  a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which
         he is the constant victim.  To him, your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your national greatness,
         swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless; your denunciation of tyrants, brass fronted impudence;
         your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your
         religious parade and solemnity, are, to him, mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy—a thin veil to cover up
         crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages.  There is not a nation on the earth guilty of practices more shocking and
         bloody than are the people of the United States, at this very hour. (Lowance 42)
