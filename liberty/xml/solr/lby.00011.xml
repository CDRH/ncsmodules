      <field name="text">"The sonnet, monsieur," said he, "is one of the most difficult forms
         of poetry. It has fallen almost entirely into disuse. No Frenchman can
         hope to rival Petrarch; for the language in which the Italian wrote,
         being so infinitely more pliant than French, lends itself to play of
         thought which our positivism (pardon the use of the expression)
         rejects. So it seemed to me that a volume of sonnets would be
         something quite new. Victor Hugo has appropriated the old, Canalis
         writes lighter verse, Beranger has monopolized songs, Casimir
         Delavigne has taken tragedy, and Lamartine the poetry of meditation.""Are you a 'Classic' or a 'Romantic'?" inquired Lousteau.Lucien's
         astonishment betrayed such complete ignorance of the state of
         affairs in the republic of letters, that Lousteau thought it necessary
         to enlighten him."You have come up in the middle of a pitched battle, my dear fellow;
         you must make your decision at once. Literature is divided, in the
         first place, into several zones, but our great men are ranged in two
         hostile camps. The Royalists are 'Romantics,' the Liberals are
         'Classics.' The divergence of taste in matters literary and divergence
         of political opinion coincide; and the result is a war with weapons of
         every sort, double-edged witticisms, subtle calumnies and nicknames a
         outrance, between the rising and the waning glory, and ink is shed in
         torrents. The odd part of it is that the Royalist-Romantics are all
         for liberty in literature, and for repealing laws and conventions;
         while the Liberal-Classics are for maintaining the unities, the
         Alexandrine, and the classical theme. So opinions in politics on
         either side are directly at variance with literary taste. If you are
         eclectic, you will have no one for you. Which side do you take?""Which is the winning side?""The Liberal newspapers have far
         more subscribers than the Royalist
         and Ministerial journals; still, though Canalis is for Church and
         King, and patronized by the Court and the clergy, he reaches other
         readers.  Pshaw! sonnets date back to an epoch before Boileau's time,"
         said Etienne, seeing Lucien's dismay at the prospect of choosing
         between two banners. "Be a Romantic. The Romantics are young men, and
         the Classics are pedants; the Romantics will gain the day."The word "pedant" was the latest epithet taken up by Romantic
         journalism to heap confusion on the Classical faction.
