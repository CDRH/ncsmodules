      <field name="text">FEELINGS OF A REPUBLICAN ON THE FALL OF BONAPARTE.I HATED thee, fallen tyrant! I did groanTo think that a most ambitious slave,Like
         thou, shouldst dance and revel on the graveOf Liberty. Thou mightst have built thy throneWhere it had stood even now: thou
         didst preferA frail and bloody pomp, which time has sweptIn fragments towards oblivion. Massacre,For this I prayed, would
         on thy sleep have crept,Treason and Slavery, Rapine, Fear, and Lust,And stifled thee, their minister. I knowToo late, since
         thou and France are in the dust,That Virtue owns a more eternal foeThan force or fraud: old Custom, legal Crime,And bloody
         Faith, the foulest birth of time.
