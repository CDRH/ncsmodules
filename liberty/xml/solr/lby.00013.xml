      <field name="text">SONNET ON CHILLON.ETERNAL Spirit of the chainless Mind!Brightest in dungeons, Liberty! thou art,For there thy habitation is
         the heart—The heart which love of thee alone can bind;And when thy sons to fetters are consign'd—To fetters, and the damp
         vault's dayless gloom,Their country conquers with their martyrdom,And Freedom's fame finds wings on every wind.Chillon! thy
         prison is a holy place,And thy sad floor an altar—for 't was rod,Until his very steps have left a traceWorn, as if thy cold
         pavement were a sod,By Bonnivard!—May none those marks efface!For they appeal from tyranny to God.
