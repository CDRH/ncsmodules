      <field name="text">SOCIAL LIBERTY AND FREE AGENCY: Some ambiguities in Mill's conception of
         freedomCONDITIONAL FREEDOM AND THE PRINCIPLE OF LIBERTYBefore examining the adequacy of Mill's position as a solution to the
         traditional
         problems of freedom and determinism, let us consider the implications of construing the
         liberty invoked in the principle along these lines. The idea is positive in four main
         respects:It involves what Berlin holds to be a crucial element in all positive
         versions of freedom — that of self-mastery or self-determination.Rather than mere absence of impediments to action, it is
         a matter of the
         possession of abilities and powers for self-development.Self-development is clearly for Mill a prized achievement—there is
         nothing 'value-neutral' about the notion, as there is about freedom qua uncoerced satisfaction of wants, whatever they might
         be for.The impediments to self-mastery explicitly mentioned by Mill are
         'internal' rather than 'external'—psychological defects of character such
         as weakness of will or subjection to habit, not coercion by others. On the other
         hand, it remains negative in two important respects:The actual achievement of self-mastery is not a condition of freedom.
         The
         conformist, the lazy, even the vicious, may still on this definition be free. Mill
         insists that we may 'yield to temptation' and remain free—just so long as
         we could resisit, if we wished. Freedom thus remains basically liberal in that it is
         a matter of enjoying opportunities rather than of actual positive achievements.Because the actual attainment of Mill's ideal
         of personality development is
         not presented as a necessary condition of freedom, he manages to sustain a
         distinction, often held particularly dear by orthodox liberals, between
         liberty—the opportunity to do something arising from the possession of the
         requisite powers—and what makes freedom useful or valuable: the actual
         doing or achieving of that thing.Clearly, the dichotomoy of either negative or positive freedom is simply misleading when
         applied to such a notion. Yet
         conditional freedom is precisely the idea at work when Mill makes the points he does
         about the value of a sphere of 'self-regarding' action, as it captures just those
         persons whom he is usually understood particularly to want to protect, namely those who
         may be presumed to be capable of forming their own personalities, and who may also be
         taken to want to do to so, but who are likely to feel inhibited by the prospect of
         social disapproval from expressing themselves in the way in which they feel they need to
         do. These likely exponents of individuality are to be guaranteed 'liberty of action,'
         that is to say, the Principle of Liberty ensures them a sphere of freedom within which
         they may, if they wish, take the opportunity to exercise their powers of
         self-development by practising 'experiments in living', where these do not harm others.
         This conception of freedom also squares with liberty qua 'letting
         people alone to pursue their own good in their own way', (p. 33) as well as with the orthodox liberal view of the proper
         function of the state, with which Mill is usually associated, that is, as protecting or
         conserving a freedom which individuals are presumed already to possess.However, though the conditional notion of free agency
         undoubtedly represents the core of
         Mill's understanding of liberty, additional complexities ar revealed by considering the
         implications of a common criticism of his Compatibilist solition to the problem of
         freedom and determinism. It is often argued that, strictly speaking, Mill has no right
         to a notion of freedom as self-development because his empiricist theory of personal
         identity, which resolves the self into a Humean 'bundle of impressions', cannot account
         for the possibility of an enduring self maintaining a persisting identity through a
         series of developmental changes. Mill is in fact rather less dogmatic about
         associationism, at least as far as its implications for self-identity are concerned,
         than is sometimes represented. But it cannot be denied that this represents a void at
         the centre of his philosophical system, in that his official epistemology commits him to
         precisely that attenuated conception of personality which gives plausibility to the
         standard liberal notion of freedom as non-frustration of wants. For, if the self is
         nothing more than a bundle of perceptions and desires, nothing more than their
         unhindered satisfaction can properly be demanded in the name of liberty. However, the
         criticism which raises philosophically more promising issues for Mill is connected not
         so much with his theory of personal identity as with his ideal of personal autonomy. It
         is contended that the basic flaw in Mill's theory of freedom lies in his admission that
         'the will to alter our own character is given us, not by any effort of ours, but by
         circumstances we cannot help: it comes to us from external causes, or not at all'. An
         admission that any clear-minded determinist can scarecely avoid, yet the fallacy seems
         manifest: if we cannot actually determine our character unless we
         actually desire to do so, and if the desire for self-mastery
         cannot (as Mill admits) be self-induced, are we not all ultimately heteronomously
         motivated, and hence by his own criterion unfree?Mill makes no direct response to this challenge, and perhaps there is none
         to be made,
         though there may be more to his position than some critics have been prepared to allow.
         There is something of an irony here, however, in that the deficiencies of his answer to
         Owen at the purely metaphysical level point him in a potentially very fruitful direction
         in his social philosophy. It is simply that, if the desire for self-reform cannot be
         self-induced, the external (i.e. social) circumstances which either stimulate or inhibit
         its occurance take on crucial significance for the individual's actual engagement in the
         process of self-development—even if this latter cannot, in strict metaphysical
         terms, lay claim to being a fully or genuinely autonomous condition of character. Though
         there is no explicit evidence that Mill clearly registers the implications of his
         position, the way in which he treats Owenite social fatalism as a real threat to freedom
         (and not simply as a misguided intellectual position) suggests that he implicitly slides
         from taking the desire for self-development as merely a hypothetical requirement of
         freedom to invoking it categorically, at least in the sense that anyone prevented from
         conceiving the wish for self-reform is to be classed with those whose desire is
         frustrated as being unfree tout court. The context of this vital
         elision is to be found in Mill's comments upon the deplorable effect, as he sees it, of
         swallowing Owen's account of human impotence. One the one hand, it might 'depress' or
         'paralyse' the will of someone who already wants to engage in character self-reform, as
         do uncontrollable impulses and inveterate habits. But it can also prevent someone who
         could reform himself if he wished from even desiring to do so, by encouraging him
         falsely to think that he could not succeed even if he tried. On a strict construal of
         Mill's original condition formulation the former is, of course, unfree whereas the
         latter remains free. Mill, however, treats them as being essentially similar: in both
         cases individuals who might othewise successfully amend their own characters are
         prevented from so doing by the influence of a false ideology. Though the impediments to
         self-reform operate by way of different psychological routes, they originate in the same
         social phenomenon and eventuate in the same effect. Hence Mill's implicit elision of two
         conditions which, according to his preliminary account of conditional freedom, are quite
         distinct.By implicitly broadening the concept in this way Mill is, of course, enabled to embrace
         a far wider set of social circumstances as possible threats to liberty than could his
         liberal predecessors. It cannot, however, be over-emphasized that Mill's mind remains
         far from clear as to the precise logical contours and implications of the revolutionary
         idea of freedom which he develops as a response to social fatalism — a fact
         which, as we shall see, bears important consequences for an understanding of the central
         doctrine of On Liberty. Nevertheless, Mill in effect is operating
         with a three-factor conception of freedom, one positive, two negative. 'Complete
         freedom', as he calls it, presupposes:Possession of the capacity to alter one's character, if one wishes.Absence of impediments
         upon the exercise of this capacity when one does
         not wish to exercise it.Absence of conditions inhibiting the occurance of the desire so to
         do.The logical kernal of the idea lies in (a), and it is developed by Mill in response to
         Owen's social fatalism and offered as a form of modified Compatibilism as a solution to
         the metaphysical problem of 'free will'. When considering the kinds of constraints
         — (b) — upon the exercise of powers of self-development, Mill
         alludes in the Logic to internal psychological defects of
         character; but external impediments are mentioned in connection with the threat of
         Owenite fatalism, and everything Mill says in On Liberty about
         the dangers of coercive public opinion to freedom implies that he takes external
         constraints as relevant too. But it is in regard to (c) that Mill's worries about the
         peculiarly modern threat to freedom really take form. And it is this condition which
         bears fundamentally upon the Principle of Liberty in the essay.
