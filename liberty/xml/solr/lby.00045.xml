      <field name="text">"Liberty Bells!" where ring they not,Save where tyrant fingersHave ruthlessly unhungThe music breathing tongue?And even then,
         a hovering cadence lingersAround such spot,—So that the earnest soul's attentive earFaint murmurings of a tone may sometimes
         hear.Away on the mountain's sunny side,Away in the shadowy dells,Go listen! not a soundBreaks on the air around,Unmingled
         with the voice of those sweet bells,From morn to eventide;Out from the blossom cup, from shrub and tree, Peel forth the chimes,
         so joyously and free.Steepled far from human handsOn the rocky height,And in grottoes low,Where no step may go,And the spar
         and wreathing gems are brightAs fairy wands—There ring they on, for hands that weary never,Those bright, but unseen strings,
         are holding ever.Out upon the ocean's wings,Plumed with silvery spray,As they rise and fall;Soft, and musical,Freedom's bells
         are ringing night and day,Like tireless things;And the great bosom of the chainless tideHeaves up to greet those echoing notes
         with pride.But within the human soul,That hath listened well,Nature's every tone,Blended into one,Floweth serenely on, the
         uprising swellOf that great whole—That perfect choir, whose music would becomeDiscordant all, if Freedom's Bells were dumb.
