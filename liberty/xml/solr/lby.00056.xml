      <field name="text">The aboriginal inhabitants of these countries I have regarded with the commiseration their history inspires.  Endowed with
         the faculties and the rights of men, breathing an ardent love of liberty and independence, and occupying a country which left
         them no desire but to be undisturbed, the stream of overflowing population from other regions directed itself on these shores;
         without power to divert, or habits to contend against, they have been overwhelmed by the current, or driven before it; now
         reduced within limits too narrow for the hunter's state, humanity enjoins us to teach them agriculture and the domestic arts;
         to encourage them to that industry which alone can enable them to maintain their place in existence, and to prepare them in
         time for that state of society, which to bodily comforts adds the improvement of the mind and morality.  We have therefore
         liberally furnished them with the implements of husbandry and household use; we have placed among them instructors in the
         arts of first necessity; and they are covered with the aegis of the law against aggressors from among ourselves.But the endeavors
         to enlighten them on the fate which awaits their present course of life, to induce them to exercise their reason, follow its
         dictates, and change their pursuits with the change of circumstances, have powerful obstacles to encounter; they are combated
         by the habits of their bodies, prejudice of their minds, ignorance, pride, and the influence of interested and crafty individuals
         among them, who feel themselves something in the present order of things, and fear to become nothing in any other.  There
         persons inculcate a sanctimonious reverence for the customs of their ancestors; that whatsoever they did, must be done through
         all time; that reason is a false guide, and to advance under its counsel, in their physical, moral or political condition,
         is perilous innovation; that their duty is to remain as their Creator made them, ignorance being safety, and knowledge of
         full danger; in short, my friends, among them is seen the action and counteraction of good sense and bigotry; they, too, have
         their anti-philosophers, who find an interest in keeping things in their present state, who dread reformation, and exert all
         their faculties to maintain the ascendancy of habit over the duty of improving our reason, and obeying its mandates.In giving
         these outlines, I do not mean, fellow citizens, to arrogate to myself the merit of the measures; that is due, in the first
         place, to the reflecting character of our citizens at large, who, by the weight of public opinion, influence and strengthen
         the public measrues; it is due to the sound discretion with which they select from among themselves those to whom they confide
         the legislative duties; it is due to the zeal and wisdom of the characters thus selected, who lay the foundations of public
         happiness in wholesome laws, the execution of which alone remains for others; and it is due to the able and faithful auxiliaries,
         whose patriotism has associated with me the executive functions.During this course of administration, and in order to disturb
         it, the artillery of the press has been levelled against us, charged with whatsoever its licentiousness could devise or dare.
         These abuses of an institution so important to freedom and science, are deeply to be regretted, inasmuch as they tend to lessen
         its usefulness, and to sap its safety; they might, indeed, have been corrected by the wholesome punishments reserved and provided
         by the laws of the several States against falsehood and defamation; but public duties more urgent press on the time of public
         servants, and the offenders have therefore been left to find their punishment in the public indignation.Nor was it uninteresting
         to the world, that an experiment should be fairly and fully made, whether freedom of discussion, unaided by power, is not
         sufficient for the propagation and protection of truth—whether a government, conducting itself in the true spirit of its constitution,
         with zeal and purity, and doing no act which it would be unwilling the whole world should witness, can be written down by
         falsehood and defamation.  The experiment has been tried; you have witnessed the scene; our fellow citizens have looked on,
         cool and collected; they saw the latent source from which these outrages proceeded; they gathered around their public functionaries,
         and when the constitution called them to the decision by suffrage, they pronounced their verdict, honorable to those who had
         served them, and consolatory to the friend of man, who believes he may be intrusted with his own affairs.No inference is here
         intended, that the laws, provided by the State against false and defamatory publications, should not be enforced; he who has
         time, renders a service to public morals and public tranquillity, in reforming these abuses by the salutary coercions of the
         law; but the experiment is noted, to prove that, since truth and reason have maintained their ground against false opinions
         in league with false facts, the press, the press, confined to truth, needs no other legal restraint; the public judgment will
         correct false reasonings and opinions, on a full hearing of all parties; and no other definite line can be drawn between the
         inestimable liberty of the press and its demoralizing licentiousness.  If there be still improprieties which this rule would
         not restrain, its supplement must be sought in the censorship of public opinion.Contemplating the union of sentiment now manifested
         so generally, as auguring harmony and happiness to our future course, I offer to our country sincere congratulations.  With
         those, too, not yet rallied to the same point, the disposition to do so is gaining strength; facts are piercing through the
         veil drawn over them; and our doubting brethren will at length see, that the mass of their fellow citizens, with whom they
         cannot yet resolve to act, as to principles and measures, think as they think, and desire what they desire; that our wish,
         as well as theirs, is, that the public efforts may be directed honestly to the public good, that peace be cultivated, civil
         and religious liberty unassailed, law and order preserved, equality of rights maintained, and that state of property, equal
         or unequal, which results to every man from his own industry, or that of his fathers.  When satisfied of these views, it is
         not in human nature that they should not approve and support them; in the meantime, let us cherish them with patient affection;
         let us do them justice, and more than justice, in all competitions of interest; and we need not doubt that truth, reason,
         and their own interests, will at length prevail, will gather them into the fold of their country, and will complete their
         entire union of opinion, which gives to a nation the blessing of harmony, and the benefit of all its strength.I shall now
         enter on the duties to which my fellow citizens have again called me, and shall proceed in the spirit of those principles
         which they have approved.  I fear not that any motives of interest may lead me astray; I am sensible of no passion which could
         seduce me knowingly from the path of justice; but the weakness of human nature, and the limits of my own understanding, will
         produce errors of judgment sometimes injurious to your interests.  I shall need, therefore, all the indulgence I have heretofore
         experienced—the want of it will certainly not lessen with increasing years.  I shall need, too, the favor of that Being in
         whose hands we are, who led our forefathers, as Israel of old, from their native land, and planted them in a country flowing
         with all the necessaries and comforts of life; who has covered our infancy with his providence, and our riper years with his
         wisdom and power; and to whose goodness I ask you to join with me in supplications, that he will so enlighten the minds of
         our servants, guide their councils, and prosper their measures, that whatsoever they do, shall result in your good, and shall
         secure to you the peace, friendship, and approbation of all nations.
