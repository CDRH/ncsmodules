      <field name="text">LIBERTYSee, see where royal Snowdon rearsHer hoary head above her peersTo cry that Wales is free!Oh hills which guard our
         liberties,With outstretched arms to where you riseIn all your pride, I turn my eyesAnd echo, "Wales is free!"O'er Giant Idris'
         lofty seat,O'er Berwyn and Plynlimon greatAnd hills which round them lower meet,Blow winds of liberty.And like the breezes
         high and strong,Which through the cloudwrack sweep alongEach dweller in this land of songIs free, is free, is free!Never,
         O Freedom, let sweet sleepOver that wretch's eyelids creepWho bears with wrong and shame.Wake him to feel thy spirit nigh,And
         like a hero do or die,And smite the arm of tyranny,And lay its haunts aflame.Rather than peace which makes thee slave,Rise,
         Europe, rise, and draw thy glaive,Lay foul oppression in its grave,No more the light to see.The heavenward turn thy grateful
         gazeAnd like the rolling thunder raiseThy triumph song of joy and praiseTo Godâ€”that thou art free!
