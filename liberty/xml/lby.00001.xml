         <p>But Rowan was a man more thoughtful than Cornbury, and was specially thoughtful as to
            his own position. He was a radical at heart if ever there was a radical. But in saying
            this I must beg my reader to understand that a radical is not necessarily a
            revolutionist or even a republican. He does not, by reason of his social or political
            radicalism, desire the ruin of thrones, the degradation of nobles, the spoliation of the
            rich, or even the downfall of the bench of bishops. Many a young man is frightened away
            from the just conclusions of his mind and the strong convictions of his heart by dread
            of being classed with those who are jealous of the favoured ones of fortune. A radical
            may be as ready as any aristocrat to support the crown with his blood, and the church
            with his faith. It is in this that he is a radical; that he desires, expects, works for,
            and believes in, the gradual progress of the people. No doctrine of equality is his.
            Liberty he must have, and such position, high or low, for himself and others, as each
            man's individual merits will achieve for him. The doctrine of outward equality he
            eschews as a barrier to all ambition, and to all improvement. The idea is as mean as the
            thing is impracticable. But within,&#8212;is it in his soul or in his
            heart?&#8212;within his breast there is a manhood that will own no inferiority to
            the manhood of another. He retires to a corner that an earl with his suite may pass
            proudly through the doorway, and he grudges the earl nothing of his pride. It is the
            earl's right. But he also has his right; and neither queen, nor earl, nor people shall
            invade it. That is the creed of a radical.</p>
